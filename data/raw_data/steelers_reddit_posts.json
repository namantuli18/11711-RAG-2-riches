They were riding out the storm when the flood waters rose dramatically. Luckily, Robyn's daughter's weren't home. They ended up having to break out of a bathroom window and swim to safety. These are some of the pics of the aftermath. The first thing Seth did when he had the ability to get back into his home was to find and save his Steelers jerseys. I made them a GoFundMe and also an Instagram story to try and raise as much as I can for them to rebuild their life. I figured Steelers Nation might be able to help out. Any amount would make such a huge difference for them. Thanks! 💛🖤\n\nHere's the links:\n\nGoFundMe: https://www.gofundme.com/f/trying-to-raise-money-for-my-fellow-wnc-friends-and-family\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/DAszw5aRghv/?igsh=MW02Z3JmeDdlcDZjMg==",

If I were to buy again I would try a medium\n\nQuality: Obviously for a $30 knockoff I expect some imperfections. The numbering might be a little off line and the nike and steelers patch are not as crisp looking. The Nfl crest and mesh begind it are different. The jersey doesnt feel quite as thick but it’s not too noticeable, if anything its a more comfortable fit.\n\nPros: \n- Stitched numbers and names\n- Not as stiff feeling\n- $30\n\nCons\n- Numbering feels a little off kilter\n- Runs a little big\n\nIf you have anymore questions Il try to answer them!\nOverall im happy with experience, I just really wanted a stitched jersey and dont want to spend a boatload of money everytime I want one. I wear a jersey maybe once a week for 6 months out of the year so I wasnt too worried about buying some expensive jersey that might get beat around or stained. I think for the quick look people might get nobody is going to argue about anything and I can be more care free with it knowing its only $30. I have heard Jenna Jerseys is a solid knockoff as well but have no experience. Anyways just wanted to share my findings to steeler nation. #HereWeGo",

        "title": "Jerome Bettis is statistically the modern GOAT of 1 yard conversions",
        "content": "So, I've seen discussions in the past debating, \"Who is the best short yardage back of all-time?\" or \"You need one yard to win the game. What RB do you trust most to get you one yard?\" The Bus is my favorite player of all-time and usually gets a mention or two, but I wanted to see if he was anything notable in this regard. I'm sure we've all seen the claims that Bettis isn't even a HOF quality player because (insert bias or dumb argument here). Or that he wasn't elite at anything or at any point. And everyone loves bringing up his 5 attempts, 1 yard, 3 TDs statline. I figured if Bettis excelled at anything, it would be converting short yardage situations... And boy, did he.\n\nA few caveats:\n\nI manually removed QBs from the data set, because QB sneak is cheating. /s\n\nThis data includes the regular season and the playoffs.\n\nObviously, the offensive line plays a big role in whether these runs are successful. I do not want to diminish that fact, but we can still try and look for patterns in the data.\n\nThis data is only from 1994 and on. 1994 is when the NFL began recording play-by-play history. That means Bettis' rookie season (his best or second best) is not included.\n\nMore importantly, this ignores all other player data before 1994. The most relevant players before then are Emmitt Smith, John Riggins, and Marcus Allen. These are the only 3 players in NFL history with more 1-yard rushing TDs than Jerome Bettis. Without complete data, it is impossible to determine how efficient they were (without poring through footage of every single game). Smith and Allen are present in the data, but Allen only has his last 3 seasons, while Smith's epic prime stretch from '91-'93 is missing.\n\nHere is the 1 yard rushing TD leaderboard:\n\n1. John Riggins - 59 TDs\n2. Marcus Allen - 57 TDs\n3. Emmitt Smith - 54 TDs\n4. Jerome Bettis - 48 TDs\n\nAlright so with that out of the way, here are some charts I made. This first one is running back carries on any down with 1 yard to Goal. Jerome Bettis is the black starred data point.\n\n[https:\\/\\/stathead.com\\/tiny\\/kyp73](https://preview.redd.it/5h1z1vy3zesd1.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=c28faa94c7d906862b789da31b4f3675f0ae7751)\n\nSince 1994, Jerome Bettis has the most 1-yard touchdown runs of any player. The line of best fit also shows that he is well above the average success rate. In fact, of the top 25 RBs for attempted 1 yard TD runs, only three RBs have/had a higher success rate.\n\n|Player|TDs|Attempts|TD %|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|Jerome Bettis|41|67|61.19%|\n|Derrick Henry|34|53|64.15%|\n|Shaun Alexander|35|50|70%|\n|Ezekiel Elliott|30|45|66.67%|\n\nNext, if the question we're asking is \"You need one yard to win the game. What RB do you play?\" then we need to look at 3rd and 4th down conversions. Winning the game by converting a 3rd/4th and 1 and running out the clock is much more common than a 1-yard go-ahead rushing TD.\n\n[https:\\/\\/stathead.com\\/tiny\\/2FDQ5](https://preview.redd.it/0xfst44mzesd1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=79b59c4bc5175e576b62c58a021ac0891d1cc18e)\n\nOnce again, Jerome Bettis is the black starred data point. Since 1994, Jerome Bettis has the most 1st down conversions on 3rd or 4th & 1 of any running back. He is also above the line of best fit when charted with all RBs who attempted 70 or more of these conversions. Of the 25 RBs that have attempted the most 3rd or 4th & 1 conversions, only 6 have/had a better conversion rate. It is worth mentioning that Jerome Bettis also has the most attempts of any RB.\n\n|Player|First Downs|Attempts|First Down %|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|Jerome Bettis|126|181|69.61%|\n|Adrian Peterson|104|147|70.75%|\n|Ezekiel Elliott|105|134|78.36% (holy shit)|\n|Ahman Green|91|122|74.59%|\n|Derrick Henry|77|103|74.76%|\n|LeSean McCoy|73|103|70.87%|\n|Willis McGahee|71|100|71%|\n\nBased on this data, I think we can say that Jerome Bettis was both highly prolific and proficient at converting 1 yard possession downs and goal-to-go. He also never had any drop-off in this regard and was just as successful at the end of his career, which is not the case for most of these RBs.\n\nI expanded my focus a bit to also include downs that were 2 yards to go. These are also considered short yardage situations and are probably even more crucial because QB sneak efficiency drops dramatically with the extra yard.\n\n[https:\\/\\/stathead.com\\/tiny\\/Uf0nY](https://preview.redd.it/if8gsjntzesd1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4705d043bacbb46e707f631df8561f4530fe487)\n\n[https:\\/\\/stathead.com\\/tiny\\/22l8S](https://preview.redd.it/l6j27e0xzesd1.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff5c17bdee8472f75b759fc240ade234687e13c1)\n\nI won't go over these with a ton of detail, but Jerome Bettis remains the most efficient player among RBs that carried the rock as much as he did in these situations. He is in the top 5 in attempts and had a higher conversion rate than the rest of the top 5. Check out the shortened URLs below each chart if you want the full lists.\n\nI did a bunch of other charting, but I think the most interesting was this:\n\n[Jerome Bettis is the goal line GOAT](https://preview.redd.it/ofsh0xa30fsd1.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9090a578a49fbd7725ddd20e7a4981cab8499d5)\n\nOn specifically **3rd or 4th Down with 1 or 2 yards to goal**, Jerome Bettis has the second most attempts and TDs. Among RBs that attempted at least 12 carries, The Bus' TD percentage is only exceeded by Priest Holmes, who had almost half as many attempts. Jerome Bettis also averaged an incredible 0.87 yards per attempt. Looking at the individual plays, **Bettis was literally never stopped for negative yardage in this situation.**\n\nAs mentioned, this data leaves out a lot of great players pre-1994. And Emmitt Smith scored 15 1- or 2-yard TDs before 1994. Hell, Bettis scored 4 TDs from 1 or 2 yards away in his rookie season. But this level of efficiency would be incredibly difficult to top. We all know about the fumble in Indy that almost sank the Super Bowl run. That one happened on 1st and Goal from the 2. It's honestly unbelievable how that went down, considering Bettis' record up to that point. Despite that, if I'm at the goal line and need to score to win the game, I'm taking the Bus every time. \n\nCredit to Stathead and their one-month free subscription that I got just to satiate my curiosity.",

        "title": "Addressing the QB situation",
        "content": "Due to the outrageous number of fans questioning Tomlin's decision regarding not starting Russell Wilson, I'd like to address a few things.\n\nTomlin is an elite strategist, especially excelling at making decisions based on analyzing information as it's delivered. Definitely a week to week process, while still building a long term strategy.\n\nJustin Fields coming to Pittsburgh, put him in a significantly different situation than when he was in Chicago. He's now in a better organization, with better coaches, better offense. Give him a chance to develop & get used to this offense. Keep in mind, starting Fields is giving the young QB who was in a much worse situation in Chicago, to keep his confidence & assuring him the organizations plans for him to become the future QB. Russell Wilson being a veteran QB, obviously knows this, & knows his role; he's 35 years old, he's a short term option. Pittsburgh is gonna utilize Wilson's veteran knowledge &  allow Russell to work with Fields & prepare the young QB to fulfill the role as the future QB we all need. \n\nSo far, Fields has showed continuous improvement. He's building chemistry & gaining familiarity with the offense, his passing charts reflects this every week. Why bench him? \n\nTomlin's approach is 'This is a MARATHON not a sprint'. Miami is a perfect example. They've got a decent team, but without Tua they fell off a fucking cliff. They put all their eggs into a single basket. Shoulda saved some cap space for a decent backup QB (especially given Tua's history), or at least had Thompson & Huntley build more chemistry (they obviously have minimal) with the offense during practice. Unlike Miami, Pittsburgh wouldn't be totally fucked if in a similar situation. As long as Fields is showing improvement & we continue to get dubs why start Russell? Always gotta have a backup plan. So far, no other team has had the opportunity to study film on how Russell will be utilized with the Steelers. Why show our hand just yet, when we don't need to? Maybe, Tomlin's letting Fields start the easy matchups we have now, & allowing Russell to heal up 100% while preparing him for the tougher divisional & other games (KC) we have after our bye week. Who knows, we don't know what's transpiring behind the scenes.\n\n It sucks as a die hard fan to see so many fellow Steelers as 'armchair coaches'  who think they could do better & doubt our HC who has proven he's one of the best coaches in history. \n\nRemember: Tomlin can't give you all the ingredients to the hotdog. You might not like it. \n\nSteeler Nation, LFG!!!",

Not to mention Wilson doesn’t have the same upside of rushing ability Fields has which is even more important now with injuries on the line. Apart from a few, granted, costly mistakes, Fields has put the team in the position to win games and did a good job bringing them back from behind at the end of the game yesterday until that sack stemming from not being ready for the snap. Right now, he is our best running back (Corderrelle Patterson might have something to say about that) and is our only other offensive weapon actually making plays other than Pickens. I feel like a QB change now would change the offensive dynamic we have going on even though that dynamic isn’t actually very dynamic. Just doesn’t make sense to me at this point, plus we could get a better feel for if he is actually our guy going forward after this year or if the longer he plays, the more Chicago-y he becomes.

You just need to know when to throw the damn ball away and count your losses. Fields allowed himself to get sacked way too many times last week; one of these sacks led to a game-changing fumble. Personally, I am very high on fields, but if he doesn't get this part of his game under control, I seriously don't see it ending well for us. I know he is super talented on the ground and through the air, but this not throwing the ball away when nothing is there is just boneheaded mistakes he shouldn't be making.

On the play you can see it happen in real time and just before the snap comes, Fields basically gets lost looking at the defense, seemingly forgetting that he told the o-line he was ready. \n\n\n\nThey actually follow this pattern whenever they are in a silent count, you can see many examples here once you know what to look for: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chEl-sE1MyE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chEl-sE1MyE) The fumble happens at 8:30.

However, I don’t think we as a fanbase should get lost in the moment and should recognize that there were some huge positives in the long term with this game.\n\n1. Fields has established himself as the QB1 for the foreseeable future. \nHonestly, i like russ and think he probably could do marginally better this season, but the reality is fields is 10 years younger. We need a QB and he seems to love the coaching here. It benefits him to stay here longer at least in the short term. We also need him. We haven’t had this level of QB play since ben’s later years. Not from mason, kenny, and certainly not mitch. Tomlin last year said “we are not built to come from behind” well Fields just showed we can now . \n\n2. The revelations that have to come from this game regarding harris.\nI am a day one najee fan. Love him to death as a human and still as a player. However, WE NEED TO MOVE ON. Main reason being we are not the team built for a Najee Harris. His ideal situation is a line with a good push at snap. He falls forward and with a good push line is getting 4-5 YPC on a line like that. We are a more “small hole/gap” line right now. Thats why our speedier RBs outplay him so often. Couple in the lack of receiving work and we simply have a round peg trying to squeeze into a square hole. \n\n3. Defense finally exposed.\nStart by saying we have a good defense. The issue is our comp has been fairly light these last few weeks. We finally played our most talented QB and most vet/accomplished/ seen it all QB in flacco/Richardson. This isn’t some mediocre team. They lsot one score games to teams better than we faced up to this point. A good check for the D and gives them things to focus on. ( honestly there were some game changing BS calls at the end , but in general there were some mistakes that fall squarely on the defense like tackling mechanics they can work on).\n\n4. Play calling on offense.\nIts clear now that there is some meat left on the bone between Fields capabilities and what we are willing to run on offense. This type of game should be perfect for Arthur Smith to obsess over game tape. Study what fields is comfortable with and what he struggles with. Put more plays into the scheme where he can thrive and remove anything (please god some of the 1st/2nd and long runs with Najee) that hasn’t worked. \n\n5. This was the best team we played in all.\nI think the colts are getting a really bad rap because of their record. They lost close games to teams that maybe better than the teams we beat. I don’t think its a crazy statement to say they are the best team we played at least QB wise. Richardson/flacco is better than 1/3 partial Herbert &  Heinicke. Also the chiefs just put up less points against this same team.\n\nIf we can address these issues I think the sky is the limit, but i recognize some of these issues are going to be long processes to work out.",

On top of that, if it’s an obvious run situation and the offense lines up in 12 personnel under center with the 240lb RB 7 yards in the backfield, who do you think is getting the football? We had 2 starting guards out this week, and all of Cordarelle Patterson’s runs came on one drive with momentum, I haven’t watched the all 22 yet but of course Najee isn’t going to play well this week.",

If the defense is able to make one more stop (which I believe they will more times than not the rest of the season) instead of going blow for blow, that's a different game.\n\nIt is time for Arthur Smith to take the training wheels off though.

I like Najee a lot, but I think he is actually hurting our run game at this point.\n2) Defense, obviously. Highest paid defense in the NFL can't stop a geriatric Joe Flacco and let's them convert over 75% of their 3rd downs. Enough said.\n3) George Pickens has got to grow up and realize talent is not enough to carry him through the NFL. He has a lot of work to do. That fumble cost us atleast 3 points, putting this game into OT. And drops the catch in the endzone, still ended up a TD, but the point stands.\n\nOverall, probably the happiest I've been after a loss because of how Fields played.

Don't get me wrong- he had an absolutely garbage first half and a rough start to the second. But the dude came back and started moving the ball. Sure, it was too little too late, but he didn't collapse and lose his nerve. Had Tomlin not wasted that TO on a garbage challenge ge may have even been able to pull it off. Let's keep in mind, he's a few weeks into being the starting QB of this team, and I really think he's going to get better each week. \n\n\nTough beat, but 3-1 is not a bad way to start the season.

None of these QBs get as much blame as Fields, with the majority of them playing truly awful games.\n\nYou know what else, this team has a bottom offensive roster outside of QB. I would argue they are the second worst next to the Patriots. Pickens is not a WR1, Najee might be the worst starting RB in the league, Muth our probably our best offensive player lmao.\n\nTo add that Fields wasn't even the starter going into the first game, with a new OC and many new offensive pieces. The kid has played like a top 10 QB, with arguably one of the worst situations in the entire NFL.\n\nTBH it all makes sense now why I would see so much hatred for JF everywhere when he was on the Bears, just feels like jealous fans that have some angle to prove they were right.\n\nIdk man, I should be happy we are 3-1 and have looked better than I expected.

I think today was definitely proof that it’s more his problem than it is the OL or the scheme.  CP was able to light it up when he got his chance today and late last week, and Warren has been electric when fully healthy.  Najee maybe breaks something big once every couple games and his biggest play today was a reception.  He’s got the vision of Helen Keller, no burst, he’s just not been impressive at all.  Say what you want about his 3 1,000 yard seasons, but besides last year he’s never broken 4 yards a carry (career 3.9)\n\nI think it’s safe to say he walks to free agency.  Even if he is impressive the rest of the season I think they’re better off looking at a day 2 draft pick than giving Najee another contract.  I’d look at guys like Ashton Jeanty, Ollie Gordon, Nick Singleton, Quinshon Judkins, Omarion Hampton.\n\nWhat’s everyone’s thoughts on this?\n\nEdit: I’m sure I’ll get comments about Jeanty especially probably going round 1.

        "title": "Week 4 snapshot: pros/cons",
        "content": "After about 4 weeks or so, quarter of the season, teams usually show for better or worse what the strengths and weaknesses are of their team. Tomlin and other coaches have mentioned this before including Belicheck whom all have somewhat said that each 4 week stretch in essence are small “seasons” within themselves and your trying to improve “season by season” in each 4 game stretch along the way which was how it was when the league operated on 16 games making 4 “seasons”. In the first “season” of 2024; here’s what I honestly can say most would agree on when it comes to most objective observations on the team:\n\nPros: \n-Qb Production: I wanted to make this an over arching term and not just favor one Qb or another even tho Justin has been the guy. As evidence of the last two games, and season so far overall against above the line defenses in each game, the Qb room has produced way more in the short time they’ve been here than years past. We all can agree to that from the eye test. \n\n-Talent/potential in the running game: The overall trajectory of the running game has more up than down….its just the right running back needs to be back there. This could almost be a con for Najee but I’m kinda out on him but memories serves he’s always like this early season. Perhaps he minimizes contact early to be a bruiser late? Idk but I’m just not a fan of how he doesn’t attack the Los as big as he is. Outside of him, there are LANES there. BIG GAPING LANES. Patterson hits them, Warren hits them, 22 does not. Even Fields is automatic for a few on designed runs most times so far. \n\n-Defense: despite the early performance don’t be confused, this defense has talent oozing and turns up when needed. \n\nTight ends: we need more plays for these guys. There is no excuse Washington isn’t being fed more. He’s literally 5 yards if he caught it slightly behind the line. He’s too big to not be used in space. \n\nAdjustments: Say what you will about Tomlin and TA, but this team is way different in the 2nd half. Despite the lost, I never truly felt we were out of it from what I was seeing. \n\nCons: \nYoung lineman: Reign these guys in and rein them in fast. I won’t spend too much time here cuz we all more or less know, the Steelers plan to have Jones, MCCormick, Frazier, Spencer, Fautaunu to be the line long term. Especially Frazier. I love what he brings up front but he had a couple “welcome to the nfl” moments before that last infamous snap. They all have strengths to their game but some Achilles heels to heal. \n\nWr 2 anyone?: I’ll get to Artie Smith in a second, but jeez I’m not seeing anyone get open. 14 has gotten better in terms of separation but that’s not the strength of his game. I’d have to see the film on what the passing concepts were but it doesn’t feel we got anyone else besides 14 to route up or bully a guy to get open, the latter more so what GP is better at. \n\nILB?: Queen does some things well. Payton does some things well. But let’s slow the hype on them being Ham and Lambert. Wilson has holes in his game. Plus he hasn’t filled into an nfl body yet imo. Queen I expected more from but he does show up. I can’t dunk on him completely. He works a lot of plays with a rookie running mate and when Wilson improves, so will Queen’s frequency showing up on film in a positive. For now, the middle is kinda vulnerable with them just beyond the Los. \n\nCoordinatorS!: There’s some things that Artie smith have done I like because seeing CP hit the lanes A Smith is trying to open up shows at times “ok, this can work.”  But again going back to 22, he’s just not hittin the lanes we need. Outside that tho….the play calling on 1st needs more variety. Idk if it’s a stubborn belief but u do NOT NEED TO RUN ON FIRST TO ESTABLISH THE RUN! Colts let us feed into their run heavy n hit us with play action to START THE GAME. Run was open for a while from there. Justin can make plays and there’s plays out there to be had on first down so that you CAN RUN on 2nd down or maybe this sounds crazy….JUST GET A FIRST DOWN ON FIRST DOWN! 🤦🏽‍♂️ then T Austin I’m not the biggest fan of. It really feels like they stay in the same defense most of the game and rely on the talent to just “talent” and when we DO SCHEME a blitz or coverage, surprise surprise we get sacks which is where the adjustments come into play to their credit. However. Leads to my last con.\n\nSlow Starts: in every game, whether it felt like it truly or not, this team has started sluggish. Every. Single. Game. THAT needs to change. \n\nOverall tho, I think this team has potential which is a dangerous word but how they go after that upper level of play is their decision to make. That all said, this team is definitely trending upwards from where it was a year ago. We still got some guys out rn and the full vision hasn’t come into effect yet. Just be patient. Today we lost but it’s not like we just ass now. The Colts were at home n had a lot to play for and had a good game plan. Give them credit.",

How many of you just accept the information in charts like this without having read the [methodology](https://www.espn.ph/nfl/story/_/id/24892208/creating-better-nfl-pass-blocking-pass-rushing-stats-analytics-explainer-faq-how-work)? I usually just accept it tbh.  I found the chart above on r/AFCNorthMemeWar, so I decided to actually look into this. The stats are from ESPN Next Gen stats ([this article it seems](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41040723/2024-nfl-win-rates-top-teams-players-rankings#prwr)). ESPN classifies every player represented above as an edge with no differentiation between five techniques, seven techniques or nine techniques, etc.\n\nRecently, it has been going around that some analytics are not taking chips into consideration. I have also seen some claim that double teams are only two linemen not a lineman and a TE or RB. However for Next Gen:\n\n>we tally double-teams regardless of the position combination, so running backs and tight ends count too.\n\nSo a double-team does not only represent two linemen.\n\n>Block-and-go-type releases by tight ends and backs who do not cross the line of scrimmage are no longer counted against them as pass-block losses (and no longer count as pass-rush wins for the defender who is released).\n\nSo it is correct that chips are not counted.\n\nHere is how it works:\n\n>\\[ESPN Next Gen Stats'\\] Pass Block Win Rate metric tells us the rate at which linemen can sustain their blocks for 2.5 seconds or longer. Likewise, our Pass Rush Win Rate metric tells us how often a pass-rusher is able to beat his block within 2.5 seconds. Our model of pass blocking harnesses player tracking data from NFL Next Gen Stats.\n\nSo why 2.5 seconds? Well . . .\n\n>We chose 2.5 seconds for two reasons. First, it's about the average time to pass release on most conventional drop-back pass plays. It also appears to best separate the blockers and rushers we already know are good at what they do\n\nI think 2.5 is a a fair benchmark, tbh, but that \"blockers and rushers we already know are good at what they do\" does not seem very scientific.\n\n>Our model uses the location, proximity and orientation of each player relative to every other player throughout a play to determine who is blocking whom. When a pass-rusher beats his block, we can tell which blocker allowed the pressure. And just as importantly, we know how long after the snap it occurred.\n\nBut how do they determine whether one beats his block? Here is how:\n\n>The system also draws the pocket at each time step in a pass play. The pocket is defined as a polygon connecting all the pass blockers. When a rusher penetrates this polygon and is within a certain distance to the quarterback, we say he has won his block. \n\nSo, a computer is analyzing locations and time relative to the pocket and the QB. That \"within a certain distance\" part is a little shady in my view. Why can't we know what that distance is? Presumably, it'd be 1-3 yards.\n\nOverall, given that pocket penetration, time and distance are the key factors, one might think that the system would favor IDL over edges. However, of the best IDL only three would make the top twenty in win rate on the Edge list. This is probably because of the stark difference in double-team rate.\n\nI'd like to see the stats broken down by a technique. It seems that many of the top ten are more traditional defensive ends than what I would think of as an edge.\n\nMost will probably not read this, but I thought it was interesting to look into.",

If Fields and Mahomes swapped draft classes and the Chiefs drafted Fields and the Bears drafted Mahomes then today Fields would be a top 10 QB (maybe not Mahomes good) and Mahomes would be the Steelers starting QB.  Because the Bears suck at managing talent.\n\nI think Fields has shown enough that its reasonable to expect Arthur Smith can make him an above average QB.  I don't know his ceiling.  Athletically its very high, but maybe he lacks the processing talent to be elite.  But he's good enough and I trust our coaching staff to get it out of him that he is a viable long-term starter.  That means if we run with Fields all year he's going to costs us probably something like a 4 year 160 million extension.  Cheaper if we replace him with Russ then resign him to be the starter next year but that feels dishonest and only trying to keep his value down.\n\nOur QB depth is fantastic.  Even if Fields is the long-term starter he might get hurt and Russ is a super back-up.  From a pure trade value position it doesn't make sense to trade him for less than a second.  Because the insurance policy has value.\n\nStarting Russ is going to be the smart play to keep Fields contract cheaper.  If Fields just does what he's doing and doesn't improve its maybe 4 years 120, if he takes  a step-forward its costly.  But one reason we signed Russ is the Steelers do things the right way.  Which means going with the guy you think could be your long-term QB despite contract costs and giving Russ a chance to play this year and boost his HOF credentials.  Long-term I think treating players right has benefits.  Not the cutting Rowdy shit to save 200k.\n\nLets say the Dolphins approach us wanting Russ which has been rumored as a potential landing spot.  Would be a great landing spot for Russ to rebuild his career with a ton of offensive weapons and Tua probably should be retiring but will fight it out.  I wouldn't just give Russ away.  Being a desirable location for players to sign with we should utilize to our advantage.  Its a cap and draft league so gaining advantages is necessary.  I wouldn't push for a 2nd which might be fair value.  But something like a third and fifth works for me.  A third lets call it Darnell Washington isn't really worth the insurance policy of having Russ, but its something and treats everyone fairly.\n\nI assume Wilson wants to start this year to boost his long-term prospects and show something.  He's borderline HOF so he would prefer showing something this year to have a guaranteed starting job next year.",

        "title": "Steelers QB play through 3 weeks 2023 vs 2024",
        "content": "A big reason I decided to look into this was because it seems in the media and among fans, Justin Fields is a fairly polarizing player when it comes to how effective/good he is.\n\nFor a very simple comparison here are their stats at a glance through 3 weeks for both:\n\nedit (could not get chart to work in reddit, quick and dirty screenshot instead):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbsbqrgau0rd1.png?width=1299&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1342708a646789d846df5999659d7a684125192\n\nSimple takeaways are that Fields accounted for around 90 less yards of offense total (pass + rushing yards) with 2 less interceptions. His completion percentage is much higher though, as well as his yards per attempt and adjusted yards per attempt. (Stats from PFR)\n\nAlthough what I was really interested in was depth of target, as many of us took issue with how little we stretched the field in the passing attack last year. For this I used fantasy pros advanced QB stats tool.\n\nHere are Kenny Pickett's stats through 3 weeks in 2023:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1scbdf5ak0rd1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8afa5cd3cb220fd82f282d16c86c7de4910f1cd\n\n[https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php?year=2023&range=custom&start\\_week=1&end\\_week=3&team=PIT](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php?year=2023&range=custom&start_week=1&end_week=3&team=PIT)\n\nAnd here are Justin Fields stats through 3 weeks:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f36ncgpgk0rd1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=039d637d81b088e5b447560b1eb5f04104ffb1b2\n\n[https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php?range=custom&team=PIT&start\\_week=1&end\\_week=3](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php?range=custom&team=PIT&start_week=1&end_week=3)\n\nThe key takeaways are, in my opinion, Fields has .5 more air yards per attempt and Fields has less than half of Pickett's total poor throws, which if we extrapolate those to their attempts, Fields has a 14.6% poor throw rate and Pickett has a 23% poor throw rate. However, what is more reassuring is their respective rankings in some of these categories. If you sort the [first 3 weeks of the 2023 season](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php?year=2023&range=custom&start_week=1&end_week=3) by air yards per attempt, Pickett ranked 28th among all QBs with over 10 attempts. However, if you sort the [2024 season so far](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php) by air yards per attempt, Fields ranked 17th among QBs with 10 attempts or more. So while the .5 air yards per attempt may not seem like a lot, its a big difference in context of their performance relative to the league. Its also somewhat funny that Fields AY/A is 1.1 yards higher this year than it was at the same point last year for him, when he was ranked below Pickett.\n\nEven more reassuring though is the fact that while Fields was blitzed MORE times on LESS passing attempts than Pickett, he took 2 less sacks and was knocked down and hurried WAY LESS than Pickett, seemingly indicating that he is getting the ball out faster than Pickett did. I believe this is partially due to our offensive philosophy though since Fields seem to struggle in this aspect in his time in Chicago as well.\n\nOverall takeaway: our QB play has improved but in my opinion it's unclear that it's entirely player-based. It is pretty evident that at least some of this is Fields having aspects of his game that Pickett lacked. A reason I decided to look into this was too see if I could find any data to substantiate a perception I had that Fields is much more accurate than Pickett on deep passes. I found this chart:\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/throwthedamball\\/status\\/1836775399755223314\\/photo\\/1](https://preview.redd.it/0u6gz74rq0rd1.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc3ce87a00cb05b22ceab1cd8dd072a51c86a4bf)\n\nWhich only includes up to week two this year but seems to indicate a positive in that regard, but this would not be surprising, as this is a similar chart from last year:\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/throwthedamball\\/status\\/1729643835310145720\\/photo\\/1](https://preview.redd.it/5czi6wu0r0rd1.png?width=2088&format=png&auto=webp&s=946e06a0eb15d6398350c698b5268a650253de08)\n\nWhile not the same chart, Fields obviously trumps Kenny HARD in many deep ball statistics. As a whole, I really like our offensive philosophy this year.\n\nBut this brings me to my main point, I'm not sure that Russ can't give us the same offense that Fields is. I do appreciate Fields but from the entirety of Tomlin's rhetoric in the offseason and leading to the start of this season, the plan was never for Fields to be the starter. Obviously, they seem pretty lax in getting Russ back from his somewhat mysterious calf injury that I've only seen described as \"tightness\". It's also undeniable that Fields brings an aspect to the run game that Russ cannot, and Tomlin has said in the past he wants an athletic, mobile QB. If I had to guess, Fields likely gets the starting nod on a short leash if and or when Russ gets healthy. But if Russ becomes the starter when healthy I imagine he will also be on a short leash. If he comes in and is holding onto the ball too long, or taking too many sacks (neither of which being a problem Fields has this year and Russ has struggled with in the past) I can see Russ getting pulled mid-game even. What do you guys think?",

        "title": "Since we're doing this every week, Diontae Johnson: 8 catches, 122 yards, 1 TD",
        "content": "Many Steelers fans spent the first two weeks of the season circling the wagons over Johnson's lackluster box scores with the worst starting QB in professional football. When paired with a competent QB this Sunday, Johnson had a career outing: 8 catches, 122 yards, and 1 TD. I haven't seen any new \"we won the trade\" or \"good riddance\" posts.\n\nNow that everyone's had time to digest, I wanted to take this opportunity to put the scapegoating to bed, celebrate an underrated Steeler, and remind everyone that historically, Johnson's statistical output has been a near-perfect barometer for QB quality. \n\n**1. Johnson as a barometer**\n\nJohnson is not a talent like Justin Jefferson or Ja'Marr Chase, who can alter the course of a game in a single play. He is, however, an excellent separator with the speed and ball skills to excel with a variety of routes and catch points. He's basically the archetypal \"average starter\" in that he is consistently utilized and can do everything decently. As a result, his play has higher variance than that of bona fide superstars and/or scrubs. Those guys tend to perform the same regardless of who's under center, whereas Johnson will vary heavily based on how accurate, innovative, and consistent his target diet is. This variance makes Johnson's stats a very accurate litmus for QB quality.\n\nFor illustration, look at Johnson's statistics with each starting QB during their shared tenure:\n\n|QB|Total games|Passer Rating|Targets per game|Receptions per game|Yards per game|Touchdowns|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Ben Roethlisberger|31|90.5|9.84|6.09|62.8|15|\n|Mason Rudolph|20|80.2|7.05|4.6|61.4|8|\n|Mitchell Trubisky|13|76.5|8.15|5.46|59.9|3|\n|Kenny Pickett|21|79.1|7.81|4.2|47.9|2|\n|Devlin Hodges|8|71.4|6.5|4.25|42.6|2|\n\nThe obvious takeaway here is that Johnson's yardage and TD output is directly correlated to the quality of his QB during their shared tenure. With the exception of Pickett grading out marginally better than Trubisky, each descending QB has a worse passer rating, all the way down from late-career Big Ben to Devlin \"Duck\" Hodges. Moreover, I'd argue each descending QB had/has a worse NFL career than the last. \n\n*(Please note: the sample size for Andy Dalton and Bryce Young, one and two games respectively, is very small. Johnson posted career-bests in each statistic under Dalton, who leads this group with a 123.6 passer rating during their time together. He posted career-worsts in each with Young, who anchors the group with a 44.1. Although it greatly illustrates my point, I didn't include this in the chart because it felt dishonest to cite so small a sample.)*\n\nThe numbers are similar when you look at overall passing offense in relation to Johnson's involvement:\n\n|Season|Team Passing Offense Rank|Targets per start|Receptions per start|Yards per start|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2019|31st|7.7|4.9|56.7|\n|2020|15th|11.1|6.8|71|\n|2021|15th|12.1|7.6|82.9|\n|2022|24th|8.6|5.1|65.2|\n|2023|25th|7.9|4.6|55.2|\n\nThe takeaway here is that the more involvement Johnson gets, the better his passing offense has performed. Maybe there's a chicken-egg conversation to be had here (i.e., does involving Johnson make an offense better, or do good offenses incidentally involve Johnson more), but there is at the very least a strong correlation between his counting stats and the team's overall passing finish. \n\nAll this is to say, it's pretty clear that Johnson is a capable, talented player performing as well as possible given his circumstances. He goes the way of his QB. \n\n**2. Johnson as a Steeler**\n\nReliable three-level target in a horrible situation, was the sole competent offensive player for large stretches of the post-Ben era. All-Pro returner, Pro Bowl receiver. 77 games, 67 starts, 4363 receiving yards, 391 receptions, 25 touchdowns. Took a team-friendly deal, helped mentor budding star George Pickens out of drop issues. \n\nThe chart below summarizes his contributions succinctly:\n\n|Question|Yes|No|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|950+ yard 17-game pace|X||\n|Cool arm sleeves|X||\n|Got Mitchell Trubisky benched|X||\n|Legal issues||X|\n|Played with a top-10 passer at any point in his career||X|\n|Satisfied with losing||X|\n|Traded for a player the worst team in the NFL was about to cut|X||\n\n**3. Johnson as a scapegoat**\n\nSince he was drafted in 2019, the Steelers have struggled to recapture the offensive magic of the Killer B's era. How much of this is on him? Let's examine the evidence.\n\nThe team's quality of offensive personnel took a nosedive. Le'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown departed in varying stages of mental breakdown. Ben Roethlisberger destroyed his elbow. The offensive line was decimated by age and injury, and instead of spending money or high picks to retool it, Kevin Colbert built from the outside in. His cornerstone offensive picks to close his career were a contested catch WR who can't jump, a slow RB, a brittle TE, and a skittish QB. The post-Ben quarterback room needs not mentioning- you've watched the games. It's also worth noting that this team has been a bottom-10 spender on offense since 2019, placing lowest in the league in both 2022 and 2024. \n\nThe organization hired poorly. I'm not going to get into a debate over whose fault it is (i.e., whether Tomlin's a nepotist or Rooney's a cheapskate) because there's no way to know and we're stuck with both guys forever regardless. What I do know if *whoever* decided to hire Randy Fichtner and Matt Canada really screwed up. The organization has chosen unqualified, bad assistants, and it's really that simple. \n\nMost importantly, Ben's elbow injury in 2019 led Mike Tomlin to drastically reinvent his coaching philosophy. When Roethlisberger went down, the team relied exclusively on defense and clock control offense to win games. With a poor line, inexperienced QBs, and skill position rooms that hadn't recovered from losing Bell and Brown in rapid succession, Tomlin turned the Steelers into a dink-and-dunk powerhouse. The team ran the ball, targeted the short perimeter, and focused on protecting possession and field position. It led to exciting games, worked somewhat well, and proved replicable. Tomlin has not really asked his offenses to do anything since. \n\nIn short, the Steelers offense lost talent, chose poor coaches, and shifted to a philosophy that de-emphasizes scoring and yardage. \n\nHow is that Johnson's fault? See the helpful chart below:\n\n|Issue|Culprit|Explanation|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Every player retires, gets injured, or goes insane; Colbert forgets how to GM for 5 years|D. Johnson|???|\n|Two very bad offensive coordinators hired|D. Johnson|???|\n|Mike Tomlin concludes accruing yards is boring, attempts to become first coach to win a game with negative yardage|D. Johnson|???|\n\n***Hmmm, not really adding up. Why is Johnson so hated?*** \n\nI'd posit three reasons. \n\nFirst, he had a handful of high-profile third down drops in 2020. Since then, he has been statistically one of the league's most reliable pass-catchers, with drop rates on par with \"safety blanket, QB's best friend\" type guys like Keenan Allen. Unfortunately, when a player develops the \"bad hands\" reputation, fans tend to notice and react more negatively to drops. Fans consider players like Adam Thielen, Christian Kirk, and Courtland Sutton to be far more reliable targets than Johnson, yet last season, each had a drop rate more than twice as high as Johnson's with similar target volume and QB play. You don't hear people complain about it because people care more about vibes than statistics.\n\nSecond, Johnson moves laterally or even backwards to try to get more yards. This is a common strategy used by players who are fast and good at football. The strategy can be frustrating to watch, though- the Steelers don't know what spacing is and Johnson isn't the strongest, so moving in that way often ended up losing yards. Johnson's running style after the catch was totally understandable- the post-Ben QBs rarely hit him in stride. If I caught one good ball a month, I'd try to turn it into a home run, too. \n\nLastly, Johnson showed frustration in highly visible ways. He cussed out Mitchell Trubisky for sucking at football, leading to Trubisky being benched. He aggressively called for the ball when routinely missed by Kenny Pickett. He missed a Jaylen Warren fumble against Cincy and stood there while someone else picked it up, which looks really bad if you pretend he saw the fumble occur. Grave offenses, all of them. \n\nChart below:\n\n|Crime|Punishment|\n|:-|:-|\n|Improved catching|Offender labelled \"unreliable\" until the end of time|\n|Tried to turn monthly Good Target into big play|HE CAN'T GO NORTH AND SOUTH!!!! AHHHH|\n|Acted upset when the offense sucked|Offender traded to only team in the league with a starting QB worse than Kenny Pickett|\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe statistics are what they are. Diontae Johnson is not a boogeyman, a bum, or a diva. He's a competent starting WR and a mirror to a his team's QB play. I'm wishing him good luck and crossing my fingers that the vocal minority will drop the constant, tired complaining about him.",

However after seeing week 3 play out I think our wins are only looking more impressive.\n\nChargers - Obviously the talk going into this game was the Chargers #1 ranked defense and running game both of which we dismantled. -5 yards in the second half speaks for itself.\n\nBroncos - We made the Broncos look so awful on offense that everyone just assumed Nix was out of his depth in the NFL and Payton was washed. This game also fed into the misconception that our offense was struggling especially due to the BS penalties. Denver just dominated Tampa and Baker who people were starting to talk up quite a lot (love to baker still, fuck the browns) but clearly theres more to the Broncos than people thought. Their week 1 loss was also just a one score loss against seattle who looks good.\n\nFalcons - Finally I think this win has aged the best so far. We started off the Falcons season by making national media think that Atlants was in trouble for the year, then they come out immediately and beat the eagles and take the chiefs down to the wire. I think its obvious that the Falcons are a serious team not to be underestimated.\n\n\nTL;DR This is actually a pretty impressive 3-0 record with wins over good teams and definitely not the \"cakewalk\" early schedule I've seen some people suggest. At this point I think we're confidently a top 5 team and theres no team in the league I'd be afraid to face right now.",

He has a massive contract which would suck to have to take on, but I’d be okay with sending a high draft pick if we could convince the raiders to take on most of the burden of the contract. That team seems to be years out of serious contention, so there’s no reason for them to just sit on an elite WR when they could have draft capital instead. \n\nIts still early in the year, but judging our play so far, we are looking like possible contenders for a deep playoff run, I think we should just engage “win now” mode and make a push to get another legitimate threat at WR. It would open up Pickens to a lot more one on one situations and would give us a very talented WR that is proficient in all aspects of the position. Plus, Adams looks miserable and it seems that he might be putting strain on the team based on vague comments made my Pierce, I wouldn’t imagine it would take much to get them to bite on a trade.",
