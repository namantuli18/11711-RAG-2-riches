This was the beginning of emoticons in email, and the precursor to emojis. ;-) :-( :-o Fifteen minutes & counting Carnegie Mellon alumnus Andy Warhol was an iconic figure in the pop art movement that explored the relationship of art to modern celebrity culture and advertising. His work included hand drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, silk screening, sculpture, film and music. A pioneer in computer-generated art, he is considered one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Changing the way the cookie crumbles It's never too early for women to learn the art of negotiation, and that's why a Carnegie Mellon professor has partnered with the Girl Scouts. The first Girl Scout badge for negotiation, named "Win-Win: How to Get What You Want," started with CarnegieMellon professor Linda Babcock. To earn the badge, girls learn why and how negotiation can be useful and it goes beyond selling cookies. Babcock has also co-authored two books on the subject: Women Don't Ask and Ask for it: How Women Can Use the Power of Negotiation to Get What They Really Want . Cruise controlled In 1979, Carnegie Mellon established the nation's first Robotics Institute. Since then, professor and alumnus William "Red" Whittaker has been a robotics pioneer, founding the discipline of Field Robotics, developing unmanned vehicles to cleanup the Three Mile Island nuclear accident site, and leading the Tartan Racing Team to victory in the $2 million Urban Challenge robotic autonomous vehicles race. Technologies like these can help make driving safer by preventing accidents.

Dr. Farnam Jahanian President Henry L. Hillman President's Chair As CMU continues to work together to create a more diverse, inclusive, equitable and multiculturally aware community, we are guided by our vision of a framework for inclusive excellence. Together, we can use this framework to reflect our shared goals, promote transparency and accountability, and align our strategies and everyday action to our core DEIB values. Dr. Wanda Heading-Grant Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Diversity A broad concept that includes differences in societys opportunities, the shaping of social institutions by different social factors, the formation of group and individual identity, and the processes of social change. This includes race, class, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, disability, language, and region of residence, among others. Equity Equity occurs when all people or groups in a community are given access to the correct number and types of resources that enable them to achieve equal results. Equity differs from equality, which focuses on the equal distribution of resources, rather than on equal results. Inclusion The notion that an organization or system is welcoming to new populations and/or identities. Each new presence is not merely tolerated, but expected to contribute meaningfully to the system in a positive, mutually beneficial way. Inclusive processes and practices strive to bring groups together to make decisions in collaborative, mutual, and equitable ways. Belonging Mutual power, access, and opportunity among all groups and individuals within a shared community (such as a society, organization, club, etc). Operationalizing belonging requires that all groups and individuals can contribute to and impact the community to which they seek to belong. Their contributions and impact may entail a profound transformation of the community itself, beyond the mere inclusion of individuals within them.

Rankings -     CMU - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University    Search Search CMU  About              Rankings Rankings College and university rankings continue to proliferate, but their value to individuals and to the institutions remains a subject of some debate. Some rankings are designed purely for entertainment, little more than internet photo galleries. Others make a more serious effort at collecting information. Even where rankings do collect objective statistics such as test scores or costs, the choice of which factors to include in a ranking, and how those factors are weighted, remains subjective. The effects of those methodologies, and the reasons for those choices, are not always readily apparent. For prospective students, families, potential staff and faculty who are deciding whether to invest time and resources in an institution, it is essential that you decide what factors are important to your success and the outcomes you seek.

History -     CMU - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University    Search Search CMU  About              History Andrew Carnegie A self-educated "working boy" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa. Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist. He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century. Carnegie Technical Schools At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that "to die rich is to die disgraced." He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities. "My heart is in the work," he stated, which would become part of the school's official motto. The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College. Carnegie Tech  Early Years Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or "Carnegie Tech." During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. Some key developments were: It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories  the hands-on center of learning that persists today. It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs. The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him. Carnegie Tech - Post-war Years With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study. University culture also changed in 1973 when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms. The times were changing, and Tech positioned itself at the forefront, opening three new schools: 1948: The Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed the David A. Tepper School of Business , focusing on quantitative analysis and pioneering the field of management science. 1968: School of Urban and Public Affairs, later renamed the H. John Heinz III College , providing graduate training for work in the public sector. 1986: School of Computer Science , pioneering computing and artificial intelligence, led by interdisciplinary efforts of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon. Carnegie Mellon University In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University. The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons. It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences . In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery. A Global Impact In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe  from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists. In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh. Today its global presence includes campuses in Qatar and Silicon Valley, Calif., more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships such as Los Angeles; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Australia; China; Portugal and Rwanda. The Future CMU is positioned like never before to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In the coming years, the university will see the largest expansion to the Pittsburgh campus since 1900. At the intersection of technology and humanity, CMU research, innovation and creativity will continue to guide our future as a world-class university. As outlined in the Strategic Plan 2025 , the university will focus on advancing the individual student experience, the broader Carnegie Mellon community experience, and the social impact of Carnegie Mellon throughout the world.

Traditions -     CMU - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University    Search Search CMU  About              Traditions Traditions Dating back more than a century, some Carnegie Mellon University traditions have a Scottish flavor (The Kiltie Band) as a nod to founder Andrew Carnegie. Other experiences blossomed from the minds of students (The Fence). Kiltie Band This kilt-clad student marching band  the self-named " Band Without Pants "  has entertained home football games with songs, chants, cheers and a quirky sense of humor since 1922. The Fence The Fence is painted between midnight and sunrise by students who then stand guard as long as they want their message to stay. Fun Fact: The original Fence was once the "most painted object in the world" until it collapsed and was replaced by a steel-concrete fence. Spring Carnival The entire community comes together for this four-day festival, Carnegie Mellon's oldest tradition. Buggy Sweepstakes A Spring Carnival highlight, students race " buggies ," often reaching up to 35 mph. Student groups design and build the aerodynamic cylinders  "pushmobiles," as they were called when the tradition started in 1920. Bagpipers It doesn't get more Scottish than bagpipes. Carnegie Mellon's Pipes and Drums can be found practicing around campus and performing at formal university events.

Homepage -     Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University    Search Search Search this site only Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is committed to fostering an environment where all members of our community have a sense of belonging. This commitment drives our pursuit of creating a space where every voice can be heard. We seek to cultivate diverse populations and perspectives and promote equity and inclusion. Our devotion to these ideals springs from a core belief in the power of education to be a transformative and enriching force for every person, irrespective of their background, identity or life circumstances. Inclusion and belonging are intricately interwoven into the very essence of our university, helping to shape our values, policies and practices. Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging are not only central to our ethos but also indispensable to our pursuit of academic excellence and innovation. Let's continue on this journey together. Contact Office of the Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer 412-268-4744 vp-dei@andrew.cmu.edu Visit Website Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion 412-268-2150 csdi@andrew.cmu.edu Visit website Messages from Leadership "Since our founding, Carnegie Mellon University has been committed to promoting academic excellence and economic mobility through education. Succeeding on this front requires us to both expand access and remove barriers to opportunity in pursuit of a more inclusive and diverse learning environment. These efforts are ongoing and remain critical to our university's mission to advance learning, research, and creativity and make a positive impact on society more broadly." Dr. Farnam Jahanian President Henry L. Hillman President's Chair As CMU continues to work together to create a more diverse, inclusive, equitable and multiculturally aware community, we are guided by our vision of a framework for inclusive excellence. Together, we can use this framework to reflect our shared goals, promote transparency and accountability, and align our strategies and everyday action to our core DEIB values. Dr. Wanda Heading-Grant Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Diversity A broad concept that includes differences in societys opportunities, the shaping of social institutions by different social factors, the formation of group and individual identity, and the processes of social change. This includes race, class, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, disability, language, and region of residence, among others. Equity Equity occurs when all people or groups in a community are given access to the correct number and types of resources that enable them to achieve equal results. Equity differs from equality, which focuses on the equal distribution of resources, rather than on equal results. Inclusion The notion that an organization or system is welcoming to new populations and/or identities. Each new presence is not merely tolerated, but expected to contribute meaningfully to the system in a positive, mutually beneficial way. Inclusive processes and practices strive to bring groups together to make decisions in collaborative, mutual, and equitable ways. Belonging Mutual power, access, and opportunity among all groups and individuals within a shared community (such as a society, organization, club, etc). Operationalizing belonging requires that all groups and individuals can contribute to and impact the community to which they seek to belong. Their contributions and impact may entail a profound transformation of the community itself, beyond the mere inclusion of individuals within them.

Hopfield of Princeton University and Geoffrey E. Hinton of the University of Toronto in recognition of their foundational work in machine learning with artificial neural networks. Inspired by the human brain, artificial neural networks are computing systems used to process data and learn from it. Hinton served on the Computer Science Department faculty at Carnegie Mellon University from 1982-87. He received Carnegie Mellon's 2021 Dickson Prize in Science (opens in new window) . "The Nobel Prize is one of the most significant and cherished public recognitions of researchers today," said CMU President Farnam Jahanian (opens in new window) . "Our extended Carnegie Mellon University community is extraordinarily proud to see Geoffrey Hinton's talents and pioneering research celebrated in such a meaningful way and grateful for his many scholarly contributions to computer science, AI and society." At CMU, he co-authored an influential paper on the backpropagation algorithm, which allows neural networks to discover their own internal representations of data. He demonstrated that the algorithm enabled neural networks to solve problems previously thought to be beyond their reach. The prize announcement also cites work Hinton did on Boltzmann machines with Terrence Sejnowksi, then at Johns Hopkins University. Later, at the University of Toronto, Hinton and his students made improvements to convolutional neural networks that cut error rates for object recognition in half, reshaping the field of computer vision. The laureates work has already been of the greatest benefit. In physics we use artificial neural networks in a vast range of areas, such as developing new materials with specific properties, said Ellen Moons, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics. At the University of Toronto, Hinton advised Ruslan Salakhutdinov (opens in new window) as he pursued his Ph.D. from 2005-09. Now the UPMC Professor of Computer Science in CMUs Machine Learning Department (MLD), Salakhutdinov cited Hinton as his key influence. I wouldnt be where I am today without Geoff and his guidance, Salakhutdinov said. Geoff basically discovered this unique algorithm that could train these deep networks efficiently. This laid the groundwork for a lot of the deep learning models and architecture, and it inspired a lot of people to start looking into it  it was all driven by Geoff. Salakhutdinov continues to work on generative models at Carnegie Mellon, including large language models, AI agents, deep learning and decision making. He said that Hinton thought fondly of CMU. When he was at CMU, it was amazing. He would go to CMU and see all of these students and researchers in the labs working hard and believe that they were creating the future, and that unique environment was something that he loved, Salakhutdinov said. As the director of MLD at CMU, Zico Kolter is guiding the School of Computer Science through the research revolution brought on by generative artificial intelligence tools. His own research revolves around machine learning, optimization and control, with much of the work centered on making deep learning algorithms safer, more robust and more modular. Kolter previously demonstrated how its possible to circumvent the safeguards of large language models . The field Geoff helped spawn  deep learning  has become one of the biggest things in our society, Kolter said. Almost all modern AI systems are based on deep learning. Geoff was foundational to deep learning. Born in 1947 in London, Hinton received his Ph.D. in 1978 from The University of Edinburgh. As an ACM Turing Award winner (along with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun for their revolutionary work on deep neural networks), Hinton is the second person ever to earn both a Turing Award and a Nobel Prize  the first being another Carnegie Mellon professor, Herb Simon (opens in new window) . The Nobel Prize comes with an award of 11 million Swedish Kronor, or $1 million, split between the winners.

The students  Claire Jin, Yunshu Li and Katherine Parry  were selected from a pool of more than 5,000 applicants for the federally endowed award, which provides coverage fees, books, room and board, and tuition up to $7,500. The award from the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation (opens in new window) is specifically awarded to sophomores or juniors who display academic rigor and a strong commitment to pursuing education in the natural sciences, engineering or mathematics. With the latest awardees, Carnegie Mellon has had a total of 51 students receive the scholarship since its inception. We are immensely proud of these three students, said CMU President Farnam Jahanian (opens in new window) . It is wonderful to see Carnegie Mellon Universitys roster of Goldwater Scholars grow and even more exciting to see our students recognized for their talents and hard work on the national stage. Congratulations to the winners from CMU  and to all the students who earned this distinction. Richelle Bernazzoli, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research and Scholar Development (opens in new window) (OURSD), celebrated the students continued success and commitment to scientific achievement and academic excellence. Claire, Yunshu and Katherine have already achieved so much in their fields, and the really exciting thing is that they are just getting started, Bernazzoli said. We greatly enjoyed getting to know them throughout the nomination process and we have been so impressed by the clarity of their goals and their dedication to their research areas. We cant wait to see where their continued education and scholarship take them. Claire Jin Claire Jin Claire Jin wants to improve how generative artificial intelligence is incorporated into robotics. More specifically, she wants to help create adaptable, reliable and transparent robotic systems that integrate with generative AI. By incorporating physical intuition, situational awareness, and the ability to infer human intentions, Jin wants to improve how people interact with robots. Additionally, by improving model generalizability to a variety of tasks and interpretability, she aims to help users troubleshoot more easily. The third-year student in the School of Computer Science (opens in new window) is working with the Connecting Language to Action and the World (CLAW) Lab (opens in new window) on how AI programs reason and converse when they collaborate with humans or other robots to perform tasks without a single solution. Knowing the caliber of previous scholars and their remarkable achievements in both industry and academia, I feel a sense of awe and gratitude, Jin said. It's an incredible honor to be recognized among such esteemed individuals, and I'm eager to contribute similarly with my future research. Jin, who will earn her bachelors degree in AI with an additional major in statistics in December, already has a great deal of experience working with large language models, and plans to pursue a Ph.D. Her previous work includes using large language models for text-based game development and bug detection with Microsoft Researchs Natural Language Processing Group (opens in new window) , refining multimodal models with its Knowledge and Language Team (opens in new window) , and optimizing queueing strategies through reinforcement learning. Jin began her research journey in high school, where she led a project under mentorship from Zita Oravecz (opens in new window) in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies (opens in new window) at Penn State University (opens in new window) on predicting stress onset in adolescents based on physiological signals collected using wearable devices. The work was later published in 2023 following reanalysis using deep learning methods Jin learned at CMU and presented at the IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Body Sensor Networks (opens in new window) with support from the Carnegie Mellon OURSD Presentation Award (opens in new window) . "I am deeply grateful for the pivotal role CMU's School of Computer Science has played in shaping my journey. Our school has provided me with so many enriching opportunities, from engaging in challenging classes to collaborating on projects with esteemed professors, Jin said, noting the mentorship she received from academic and research advisers Reid Simmons (opens in new window) , Weina Wang (opens in new window) and Yonatan Bisk (opens in new window) , as well as professors Daniel Sleator (opens in new window) , Daniel Anderson (opens in new window) and David Woodruff (opens in new window) , to whom she has served as a teaching assistant. Their mentorship has not only fostered my academic growth but has also imparted valuable lessons that have shaped me into a more well-rounded individual, Jin said. Yunshu Li Yunshu Li Yunshu Li, a third-year physics student in the Mellon College of Science (opens in new window) , is a Pittsburgh native whose academic research has spanned multiple fields at both Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh. Li received the Robert W. Kraemer Award (opens in new window) for her work as a first-year student. Her first research experience at CMU was in Stephanie Tristram-Nagles (opens in new window) experimental biophysics lab, where she studied novel antibiotic treatments for multidrug-resistant bacteria. She continued to make progress in the study of novel antimicrobials in the laboratory of Dr. Berthony Deslouches (opens in new window) at Pitt. One major takeaway Ive had from all of the labs Ive worked in is that theyve taught me how to ask meaningful questions, design productive experiments to explore these questions, and disseminate information effectively to diverse audiences. I am incredibly grateful for all of the mentors that Ive met during my time as an undergrad here at CMU. Working under the guidance of mentors who are both enthusiastic about research and leaders in their fields has greatly shaped my own passion for research, Li added. Currently, Li is conducting research into the effects of attention on different levels of the auditory processing pathway in the Lab in Multisensory Neuroscience (opens in new window) at CMU under the guidance of Barbara Shinn-Cunningham (opens in new window) , Abigail Noyce (opens in new window) and Ph.D. candidate Victoria Figarola (opens in new window) . An area of focus in the lab is on how our brains allow us to focus attention and suppress uninteresting sound in complex auditory environments, and what particularly excites me is the potential to leverage the insights we can gain from auditory neuroscience studies to aid individuals with hearing pathologies, Li said. What Ive enjoyed the most about working in this lab is being able to use both behavioral and computational methods in combination with noninvasive neuroimaging techniques to assess brain function in human subjects. For Li, much of what motivates her inside of the lab also takes place outside of it. As an undergraduate teaching assistant in introductory physics courses for both majors and nonmajors, she was able to explore her passion for helping others learn the sciences in the lecture hall setting. Ive really enjoyed my time as a teaching assistant, Li said. I think its taught me how to think about problems from different perspectives, and how to work on my communications skills so that I can most effectively engage with a broad range of students. Additionally, volunteering at UPMC Shadyside has influenced her research interests and bolstered her professional goals. In this volunteer position, Li works with elderly patients to help prevent hospital-acquired delirium. Working directly with patients has been a formative experience for me which has solidified my commitment to pursuing a career that can integrate research with health care. All of this work, both in and outside the lab, has inspired Li to pursue a combined MD/Ph.D. in neuroscience after her undergraduate studies. In the future, I see myself working as a physician-scientist who is seeing patients while also teaching and conducting research at an academic medical institution. Katherine Parry Katherine Parry Katherine Parry is a junior studying electrical and computer engineering (opens in new window) and physics. Katherine is amazing and beyond deserving of the Goldwater Scholarship, said Larry Pileggi (opens in new window) , the Coraluppi Head and Tanoto Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I was astonished by her passion and dedication to research. Her work is the caliber of that for a Ph.D. student, so I am excited to see the outcomes. It is exciting to be recognized for my many years of intensive research, said Parry. I am glad to contribute to the prominence and recognition that Carnegie Mellon University and the College of Engineering deserve. Parrys research focuses on designing faster computers through alternative approaches to computation. DNA sequencing, which results in new cures, and machine learning have only become feasible with faster computation, explained Parry. Interesting changes are being experienced as transistors are measured in 20-atom widths, and wire accounts for more delay than transistor gates. We're coming to the end of smaller circuitry. What will we do then? That is the answer I'm chasing. Parry is not a stranger to research. At the age of 16, she was working on a Mandelbrot generator for a science fair project. While focusing on increasing the processing speed, she discovered instances that had yet to be addressed. Mandelbrots are very square intensive, and I wanted to speed it up, Parry explained. I did some Googling and came across a couple of papers by T.C. Chen and R.H. Strandberg on how they cut the square computation in half by using Boolean logic to combine terms. However, I noticed some commonalities in the remaining elements that they hadn't addressed. I started playing around with the logic, and the elements got ugly and complicated. Tenacity is an important characteristic of a researcher. I persisted, and suddenly, I was looking at something incredibly beautiful. Those ugly computations suddenly simplified. The optimization of squares is measured in the number of additions required. The previous 16-bit squarer requires 35 adds; mine takes 29. As a homeschooled student in South Dakota, there were limited opportunities for Parry to discuss her findings with others. Turning to the internet, she came across a call for papers for the IEEE Symposium on Computational Arithmetic (opens in new window) (ARITH). I quickly did my best to write a research paper that was due soon. They would know if I had done something original. Their response was an invitation to speak to the world's leading computer researchers at their symposium in Kyoto, Japan. Because of that talk, I became part of their community, and even though they are all across the world, we correspond often. The talk also resulted in my first published paper. When it came time to apply to colleges, Carnegie Mellon was the clear choice in her mind. Not only does Carnegie Mellon have the most professors teaching computer design, but we have all the tools, and unheard of, we can tape-out computer chips, explained Parry. I have had several very famous researchers from the ARITH community envious of my CMU resources and ask to co-author papers so I can provide more credibility to their ideas. It wasn't by chance; I made a very informed decision in choosing CMU. As for her career goal, that is an easy decision, too. I want nothing more than to be a research professor at CMU, says Parry. I love doing research, and Carnegie Mellon University is a great place to do it.

You really cant get away from it, said Sean Burke, vice president of a healthcare startup who is pursuing a masters degree in public management (opens in new window) at Carnegie Mellon University. Even if I try to stay off of political subreddits, I cant watch a video on Youtube without seeing ads for both candidates. You truly have to be in the woods offline if you want to avoid it. It can be challenging to break away from the screens, in part because social media is designed to keep users engaged and online. Ari Lightman (opens in new window) , a distinguished service professor of digital media and marketing in Carnegie Mellons Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy (opens in new window) , explained,  The algorithms on social media platforms work in a similar fashion to how marketers use recommendation engines.These systems can help predict what content online users will likely engage with or consume. In addition, through ingesting vast amounts of usage data and associating it with online personas, algorithms can predict your interests and community associations with your behavior patterns. This is especially true when there is a high degree of relevance between messaging and an online user's ideology. There is no escaping it. It is happening continuously and constantly . Can legislation help ease election anxieties? Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., together with Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., recently introduced legislation to create mental health warning label requirements for social media platforms. The bipartisan Stop the Scroll Act (opens in new window) would ensure users are aware of the potential mental health risks associated with social media use. The average person spends 2.5 hours a day on social media. According to this years American Psychiatric Associations annual mental health poll (opens in new window) , adults in the U.S. are feeling increasingly anxious, with 73% of those surveyed saying they feel particularly anxious about the election. People are getting fed up with the political discussions online, but there is still a heavy population thats using social media to promote their messaging and appeal to their base, so were constantly exposed to it, Lightman said. Were constantly inundated. How are CMU professors addressing anxiety? J. David Creswell (opens in new window) , the William S. Dietrich II Professor in Psychology and Neuroscience at CMU, said if people care about the outcome of an upcoming election, it can be easy to get stuck in patterns of anxiety and stress. Election season is kind of like riding in a plane. We dont have much control over what happens, and for some people that can be overwhelming, Creswell said. One approach can be  to wrestle back a sense of control during election season  is to think about ways you do have control, such as how you can vote and make a difference. Researchers call this coping strategy cognitive reappraisal. Its basically thinking differently in ways that lessen our negative emotions. Creswell has dedicated much of his research to understanding how mindfulness and equanimity can enhance resilience and performance. L everaging over 15 years of research from his Health and Human Performance Lab (opens in new window) at CMU, Creswell co-founded Equa (opens in new window) , a mindfulness training app designed to help users manage stress and improve their overall wellbeing. CMU students, faculty and staff can download the Equa app (opens in new window) and use their @andrew.cmu.edu email address to unlock a complimentary subscription, thanks to the universitys partnership with Equa Health. What strategies are students using to cope with election anxiety? Sofia Reyes Franco considers herself somewhat anxious about the election. As a senior studying information systems at Carnegie Mellon, she is familiar with how algorithms work. Shes actually in the process of developing an app that would use algorithms to help develop personal styling choices. Franco has plenty of friends who discuss politics online and in person, but she prefers to keep her political views to herself. Im trying to stay out of it for the most part, she said. My voice will be heard when I cast my vote. Francos strategy for keeping calm between now and Nov. 5 includes staying off social media and keeping busy with school work and other interests. Im on the Club Swimming (opens in new window) team, so Ill go to practice. Club swimming is a fun way to keep in shape and be part of a great group of people on campus. We have practices three times per week and have various social events, Franco said. But mostly, Ill just focus on my homework. I also read a lot. Ill read just to kind of get myself out of this space and be transported into a different reality. Burke has a golden retriever that loves to go on walks, so getting outdoors will be his number one strategy for managing stress between now and election day. He and his wife also enjoy going to the gym. The analytical approach to social media and elections As students in Lightmans Measuring Social (opens in new window) class this semester, Burke and Franco are gaining tools and knowledge for analyzing social media to benefit global brands, and they are getting to apply it all in real time. Good timing or bad timing, its super interesting to be taking this course during the presidential campaign. Well learn and discuss something in class, and then Ill look at my phone and its all right there. So, theres that epiphany moment of oh, right, that makes sense. he said. Given thevigorous and sometimes heated debates online,Burke particularly appreciates Lightmans analytical approach. It really helps you to take a step back and put a different lens on how you view these things, to look at whats happening online more objectively rather than get caught up in it, Burke said.

Managing Election Anxiety May Mean Less Time on Social Media - Carnegie Mellon University

Managing election anxiety may mean less time on social media. Experts say that the constant stream of campaign ads and political news can be overwhelming. To break away from the screens, try staying offline and engaging in activities that promote mental well-being, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones. By focusing on what you can control, such as how you vote, you can take back a sense of control during election season.

Here are some tips to help you manage election anxiety:

1.  **Practice cognitive reappraisal**: This involves thinking differently about the situation and finding ways to manage your emotions. You can try to focus on what you can control, such as how you vote, and take a step back to look at the situation more objectively.
2.  **Stay active**: Engage in physical activity, such as exercise or sports, to help reduce stress and anxiety.
3.  **Calm your mind**: Use meditation or other relaxation techniques to help manage your emotions.
4.  **Focus on what you can control**: Instead of getting caught up in the constant stream of information, try to focus on what you can control, such as how you vote.

This commitment drives our pursuit of creating a space where every voice can be heard. We seek to cultivate diverse populations and perspectives and promote equity and inclusion.

Inclusion and belonging are intricately interwoven into the very essence of our university, helping to shape our values, policies and practices.

Succeeding on this front requires us to both expand access and remove barriers to opportunity in pursuit of a more inclusive and diverse learning environment. These efforts are ongoing and remain critical to our university's mission to advance learning, research, and creativity and make a positive impact on society more broadly." Dr. Farnam Jahanian President Henry L. Hillman President's Chair As CMU continues to work together to create a more diverse, inclusive, equitable and multiculturally aware community, we are guided by our vision of a framework for inclusive excellence. Together, we can use this framework to reflect our shared goals, promote transparency and accountability, and align our strategies and everyday action to our core DEIB values. Dr. Wanda Heading-Grant Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Diversity A broad concept that includes differences in societys opportunities, the shaping of social institutions by different social factors, the formation of group and individual identity, and the processes of social change. This includes race, class, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, disability, language, and region of residence, among others. Equity Equity occurs when all people or groups in a community are given access to the correct number and types of resources that enable them to achieve equal results. Equity differs from equality, which focuses on the equal distribution of resources, rather than on equal results. Inclusion The notion that an organization or system is welcoming to new populations and/or identities. Each new presence is not merely tolerated, but expected to contribute meaningfully to the system in a positive, mutually beneficial way. Inclusive processes and practices strive to bring groups together to make decisions in collaborative, mutual, and equitable ways. Belonging Mutual power, access, and opportunity among all groups and individuals within a shared community (such as a society, organization, club, etc). Operationalizing belonging requires that all groups and individuals can contribute to and impact the community to which they seek to belong. Their contributions and impact may entail a profound transformation of the community itself, beyond the mere inclusion of individuals within them.

Past Presidents -     Leadership - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University    Search Search Search this site only Leadership Leadership  The President              Past Presidents Past Presidents Subra Suresh, 2013 - 2017 Subra Suresh served as the ninth president of Carnegie Mellon University from July 1, 2013 until June 30, 2017. During his tenure, Suresh initiated the year-long, campus-wide effort that resulted in the universitys Strategic Plan 2025, and oversaw an historic expansion of the universitys facilities, highlighted by the creation of the David A. Tepper Quadrangle. Among his signature accomplishments were the creation of the Presidential Fellowships and Scholarships program, implementation of the strategic plan, assembling the most diverse leadership team in university history, launching an initiative to enhance the CMU Experience, forging new partnerships with global interests such as Tata Consulting Services , and hosting President Barack Obamas White House Frontiers Conference . Suresh also led the establishment of several major programs and initiatives at Carnegie Mellon, including: the Simon Initiative to enhance the impact of technology-enhanced learning within the university and around the globe; BrainHub , to further CMUs interdisciplinary strengths to advance brain research; and the Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship A distinguished engineer and scientist, Suresh was the first and only university president to be elected to three major National Academies  the National Academy of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. He is also an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors. Prior to his tenure at Carnegie Mellon, Suresh served as director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), and dean of the School of Engineering and the Vannevar Bush Professor of Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Suresh received his bachelor of technology degree from the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras; a masters degree from Iowa State University; and completed a doctor of science degree from MIT. Following postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, he joined the faculty of engineering at Brown University in 1983, and was promoted to full professor in 1989. He joined MIT in 1993 as the R.P. Simmons Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and served as head of MITs Department of Materials Science and Engineering from 2000-2006. View Dr. Suresh's video archive Jared L. Cohon, 1997 - 2013 After becoming president of Carnegie Mellon University in 1997, Jared L. Cohon guided all of the university's global expansion efforts, and successfully led the university on a variety of fronts, including diversity, technology, international education, and economic development in southwest Pennsylvania. Ranked 22nd in the world by the London Times Higher Education supplement in 2013, Carnegie Mellon became one of the largest and fastest-growing universities in terms of global expansion. Through Cohon's leadership, the university grew from having few international programs to offering 16 degree programs in 14 countries. Before joining Carnegie Mellon, Cohon served as dean of the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies at Yale University from 1992 to 1997. He started his teaching and research career in 1973 at Johns Hopkins University, where he was a faculty member in the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering for 19 years. He also served as assistant and associate dean of Engineering and vice provost for research at Johns Hopkins. Cohon earned a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 1969 and a PhD in civil engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973. An author, coauthor, or editor of one book and more than 80 professional publications, Cohon is an expert on environmental and water resource systems analysis, an interdisciplinary field that combines engineering, economics, and applied mathematics. He has worked on water resource problems in the United States, South America, and Asia and on energy facility siting, including nuclear waste shipping and storage. In addition to his academic experience, he served in 1977 and 1978 as a legislative assistant for energy and the environment to the late Honorable Daniel Patrick Moynihan, United States senator from New York. President Bill Clinton appointed Cohon to the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board in 1995 and appointed him as chairman in 1997. In 2002, President George W. Bush appointed Cohon to the Homeland Security Advisory Council , and in 2009 he was reappointed by President Barack Obama. In 2014, Cohon was appointed co-chair of the Congressionally mandated Commission to Review and Evaluate the National Energy Laboratories. He has also chaired several committees of the National Academies of Science and Engineering, most recently leading the committee that produced the report, "The Hidden Costs of Energy," and a committeethat evaluated vehicle technologies to meet national fuel economy standards. In 2012, Cohon received the National Engineering Award from the American Association of Engineering Societies. He was elected to membership in the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, also in 2012. He has received honorary degrees from Carnegie Mellon University, the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the University of Pittsburgh. Cohon currently serves as director of the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation and as University Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Department of Engineering and Public Policy. He also serves on the boards of several companies and nonprofit organizations. Robert Mehrabian, 1990 - 1997 Under Robert Mehrabian, former dean of the College of Engineering at the University of California at Santa Barbara, Carnegie Mellon continued to climb among the nation's elite universities, making great strides in improving undergraduate education and the quality of life on campus for students, faculty and staff. Enhancements in academic programs and student activities were initiated that helped student applications soar to more than 13,000 in 1996, more than doubling the amount in Mehrabian's inaugural year in office. Mentoring and advising initiatives and efforts to enhance undergraduate teaching helped to attract high-quality students and greatly improved the student retention rate. A key to realizing these major improvements was Mehrabian's implementation of external advisory boards that reviewed and critiqued every academic and administrative unit. Mehrabian oversaw the completion of the East Campus Project, an ambitious building plan for the eastern part of campus that resulted in a new $47 million University Center, two new residence halls, Gesling Stadium  a facility for intercollegiate and intramural athletics  and a new multi-level indoor parking garage. Construction during Mehrabian's tenure also included a new home for the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute at the Pittsburgh Technology Center; Posner Hall, a facility that doubled the size of the graduate business school; George A. Roberts Engineering Hall; the Intelligent Workplace, a research area for the School of Architecture; and the Purnell Center for the Arts, a new home for the School of Drama. During the Mehrabian administration, Carnegie Mellon played a vital role in the Regional Economic Revitalization Initiative, which developed a plan for economic development in the greater Pittsburgh area. Mehrabian stimulated the university's technology transfer operation and led the development of the Pittsburgh Technology Center, helping to lure the Union Switch & Signal Corporation to move its regional headquarters for research there. Richard M. Cyert, 1972 - 1990 Richard M. Cyert, known to many as the patriarch of Carnegie Mellon University, led the school to national prominence by implementing a strategy to pursue areas in which the university had the talent and expertise to make the most impact. Cyert realized that the university could not be everything to everyone, but in certain areas could be the best in the world. In his inaugural address, Cyert stressed that his major goals were to balance the university's budget, improve education and research efforts, and establish a national reputation. He succeeded on all fronts. His sponsorship of computing initiatives and willingness to take risks played an important part in the development of the computing-intensive environment that exists today. The Robotics Institute, the largest academic research center of its kind, was established in 1979, and the School of Computer Science was founded in 1988. In partnership with IBM, the Andrew computing network was completed, making Carnegie Mellon the first university to design, implement and use a local-area-network system of computing linking personal computers at all faculty and student work stations to powerful central computer resources. Cyert also led a successful initiative to expand the school's recruiting base to attract top-notch students and faculty from around the world. By 1990, when Cyert retired to return to his position as professor in the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now the Tepper School of Business), Carnegie Mellon had made the transition from an excellent regional school to a prominent national research university with students and faculty bringing diverse backgrounds and perspectives from all parts of the globe. H. Guyford Stever, 1965 - 1972 One year after his inauguration, H. Guyford Stever announced that negotiations for a merger with the nearby Mellon Institute of Research had been finalized. The new entity was originally called Carnegie University, but very shortly the Mellon family agreed to add their name to the new institution, and thus Carnegie Mellon University was born. During Stever's administration, new colleges and schools were formed. The College of Humanities and Social Sciences (now Dietrich College), the Mellon College of Science, the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now College of Engineering), and the School of Urban and Public Affairs took their place beside the College of Fine Arts and the flourishing Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now the Tepper School of Business). One school, however, the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College for Women, ceased operations. Carnegie Mellon also made dramatic advances in computing. These advancements led the way for today's School of Computer Science, the Robotics Institute, the Software Engineering Institute, and the nation's first university-wide computing network, known as Andrew. In November 1971, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon nominated Stever to become director of the National Science Foundation, and Stever resigned in February 1972. John Christian Warner, 1950 - 1965 John Warner joined Carnegie Tech as an instructor in 1926 and rose through the ranks to professor, head of the Department of Chemistry, dean of graduate studies, university vice president, and finally president in 1950. Warner, a distinguished researcher, authored more than 80 published works on scientific and technical subjects and education in colleges and secondary schools. During World War II, he headed government research on the purification and metallurgy of plutonium for the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb. Recognizing that the university would only make progress with a distinguished faculty, Warner improved faculty salaries and fringe benefits. The graduate business school, named the Graduate School of Industrial Administration, was founded in 1949 and its building completed in 1952. The first computer on campus  an IBM 650 digital type machine  was housed in the basement of the business school. In the early 1960s, Hunt Library, including the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, opened, and the Scaife Hall of Engineering was completed. Warner acquired funding to support the development of Tech's Computation Center, the origin of Carnegie Mellon's world leadership in computing. The Computation Center was a joint project of the graduate business school and the departments of Psychology, Electrical Engineering and Mathematics. Robert E. Doherty, 1936 - 1950 Robert Doherty became president in March 1936 in the midst of the Great Depression. He brought with him superb preparation for leadership, a clear vision of what technical education ought to be, a firm commitment to promote graduate education and research, and strong administrative ability. In the mid-1940s, Doherty implemented an approach to undergraduate education called the "Carnegie Plan." The Carnegie Plan provided a well-rounded "liberal/professional" education in which students were taught to apply fundamental knowledge to solve practical problems and were required to learn about and appreciate academic disciplines outside their primary area of study. The Carnegie Plan, which received much national attention, was the forerunner to today's focus on an interdisciplinary, problem-solving university curriculum. When Doherty retired in June 1950, he left behind a student body in which full-time undergraduate and graduate students outnumbered part-time night students, a revitalized faculty whose members focused their energies on both teaching and research, a dramatic new curriculum, a reorganized administrative structure, an endowment that nearly doubled during his tenure, and an institution that would very quickly become one of the nation's premier universities. Most of the seeds for today's university were sown during the Doherty administration. Thomas S. Baker, 1922 - 1935 While constant change took place during the administration of his predecessor, Thomas Baker slowed the pace, giving Carnegie Tech a chance to breath. Few new academic developments took place during Baker's administration, but he did lead work to improve the physical appearance of the campus. Lawns were seeded, trees planted, and the muddy paths between buildings were replaced with concrete sidewalks. In addition to his work at the school, Baker became an ambassador for Carnegie Tech, spending many evenings singing the school's praises to audiences throughout Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, Baker suffered from poor health during his years as president and took several extended leaves to recuperate. In 1934, his health worsened, and he resigned a year later. Arthur A. Hamerschlag, 1903 - 1922 Trustees of the Carnegie Technical Schools elected Arthur Anton Hamerschlag, a well-known figure in industrial education in New York, as its first director in November 1903. In 1912, his title was changed to president. In the early 1900s, the institution was a trade school where young working people could learn the skills they needed to advance their careers. Trustees implemented a program for students who desired more specialized training in the sciences and the arts but lacked the resources to attend a four-year college. But by 1910, students found that their three-year degrees failed to qualify them for the jobs they sought, and it became clear that the school had to change to succeed. Hamerschlag led the development of four- and five-year programs that led to bachelor's and master's degrees, and in 1912, the Carnegie Technical Schools became the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now College of Engineering). Under Hamerschlag, the campus began to grow as four new buildings were constructed  Industries Hall (now Porter Hall), Engineering Hall (now Doherty Hall), Hamerschlag Hall and the College of Fine Arts Building. Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, a women's college named for school founder Andrew Carnegie's mother, was also established.

Biography -     Leadership - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University    Search Search Search this site only Leadership Leadership  The Provost              Biography Biography James H. Garrett Jr. Provost and Chief Academic Officer James H. Garrett Jr. was named provost and chief academic officer of Carnegie Mellon University in January 2019 and was appointed for a second term in January 2024. A member of the faculty since 1990, Garrett previously served as dean of CMU's College of Engineering from 2013 to 2018. Prior to that, he spent six years as head of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. As the university's chief academic officer, Garrett is responsible for leading CMU's schools, colleges, institutes and campuses and is instrumental in institutional and academic planning and implementation. In this leadership role, he has partnered with leaders across the university to expand access and affordability efforts to meet the full financial needs of our student body. He has also had a strong focus on student success and experience so that students have the tools and opportunities they need to thrive at CMU and beyond. As provost, Garrett has made investments in supporting the holistic graduate student experience, recruiting and retaining world class faculty, and promoting equitable access to a CMU education via the launch of initiatives such as the Tartan Scholars program, the Rales Fellows program and the Student Academic Success Center. Under Garretts leadership, CMU launched its online, graduate-level certificate programs with initial offerings in artificial intelligence, 3D bioprinting and biofabrication, and computational data science. He also chaired the Commission on Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression. Garrett is deeply committed to the values of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging and to fostering an environment where all members of our community have a sense of belonging. Garrett is Carnegie Mellon plaid through and through, having received his bachelors (1982), masters (1983) and doctoral (1986) degrees in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the institution. He joined the faculty of the college as an assistant professor in 1990 and was promoted to full professor in 1996. Garrett has served in other administrative roles including associate dean for Graduate and Faculty Affairs (2000-2006) and acting dean (2004), as well as faculty co-director of the Smart Infrastructure Institute, a research center aimed at developing sensing technology for construction and infrastructure systems. Garretts wife, Ruth Ann, and their two children are all alumni of Carnegie Mellon University. Throughout his research career, Garrett has focused on how sensors and data analytics can make our cities more adaptive and efficient. This approach aims to give built infrastructures the ability to detect and report on problems directly to the humans charged with maintaining those structures, allowing for more proactive and cost-effective infrastructure management. In 2024, Garrett was a guest on CMUs inaugural podcast, Where What if Becomes Whats Next, in an episode dedicated to harnessing AI to strengthen the infrastructure of America's bridges. Among his many recognitions and awards, Garrett was elected as a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2016, awarded the title of Distinguished Member of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2018, and elected to the National Academy of Construction in 2020.

Provost Priorities -     Leadership - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University    Search Search Search this site only Leadership Leadership  The Provost              Provost Priorities Provost Priorities The university's strategic plan is the foundation for the provost's priorities, which were derived, reinforced and prioritized through ongoing listening sessions with the Carnegie Mellon community. These seven areas of focus aim to strengthen the pillars of our institution.From student success and experience to diversity, equity and inclusion, our goal is to create a more holistically supportive and welcoming environment for the campus community. AY23-24 Provost Division Year in Review Heres a look at some of the great work being done across the division to further these priorities across the CMU community. Take a Look Access and Affordability In order to increase the socioeconomic diversity of Carnegie Mellon, we must endeavor to make Carnegie Mellon more accessible and affordable. As such, our goal is to continue efforts to meet the full financial needs of our student body. We will make undergraduate student aid and graduate fellowships a primary focus in the capital campaign. And, through our partnership with the Graduate Student Assembly, we will continue to explore ways to help our graduate students afford to attend CMU, such as providing partial support for healthcare, legal services, and conference funding. Tartan Scholars End of Year Celebration, 2022 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Being a diverse, equitable and inclusive community is critical to our excellence as an educational, research and entrepreneurial university. The provost has charged the academic units with the task of creating a five-year university-wide strategic plan for diversity, equity and inclusion . In tandem, the administrative units of the university have been tasked with the same charge. Together our goal is to center our values for diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging in our institution's mission, language and climate. CMU Celebrates Pride Month, 2022 Student Success and Experience We strive to cultivate an environment that fosters student success and a high quality and supportive experience that provides opportunities for our students to grow and reflect as learners, communicators and scholars while on our campuses and beyond. All students should find success in their academic studies, graduate in a timely fashion and embark on a career pathway. In addition to academic development and enrichment programs, we also will seek to provide professional development resources for faculty and staff to excel as academic advisors and mentors. Tartan Football Team at Family Weekend, 2021 Realizing CMU Education 2025 The universitys Strategic Plan 2025 sets a vision for the type of education we seek to deliver to meet the needs of our students of the future. This vision builds upon the educational strengths of CMU that were outlined in the Carnegie Plan when the university was founded. To realize this vision, we are conducting and assessing a variety of pilots along five major dimensions: innovative curriculum, new pedagogy and technology enhanced learning, new competency-based modules, student success, new forms of interaction with external organizations and leadership education. Commencement Ceremony, 2022 Faculty Experience and Success Faculty experience and success requires adequate professional and leadership development, increased opportunities for underrepresented faculty, and access to resources for an enriching university experience. From new faculty orientation to development workshops, our priority is to provide each faculty member with the instruments they need for a fulfilling and rewarding career. Yisong Alex Guo, Associate Professor of Chemistry, 2019 Global Education Strategy Developing a global education strategy for Carnegie Mellon must explore what new international partnerships we should seek, new international educational programs we might offer, and review the existing campuses and degree programs outside of the United States. We must also examine how we can best leverage the tremendous international diversity we have across our programs, locations and campuses. Our distinctive approach to education must be evident in every program we offer, no matter where we are in the world. CMU-Africa Students, 2022 Sustainability,Efficiency and Effectiveness Sustainability reaches far beyond making "green decisions" for our campus community. Our sustainability initiative is based on the global sustainable development goals which range from peace, justice and strong institutions to good health and well-being for our campus community.

Prior to his appointment, Dr. Urban had been head of the Department of Biological Sciences in CMU's Mellon College of Science since 2010. Dr. Urban joined CMU as a faculty member in 2002 after four years as a research fellow at the Max-Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, Germany, under the supervision of Nobel Laureate Bert Sakmann. Urban received his bachelor's degree in neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh, studied mathematics and philosophy as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and earned his doctorate in neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh. In 2005, he was selected by Scientific American as one of the 50 leaders in science and technology. 2000 - 2014: Mark Kamlet Dr. Mark S. Kamlet, provost emeritus, is a professor of economics and public policy, with joint appointments in Carnegie Mellon Universitys H. John Heinz III College and in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences (SDS) in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. He joined Carnegie Mellon as a faculty member in 1976. From 1990 to 1993, he served as SDS department head. From 1993 to 2000, he served as Heinz College dean. In 2000, Dr. Kamlet began serving as provost (chief academic officer) and executive vice president of the university. As chief academic officer, he oversaw the research and educational activities of the academic side of campus, including budgetary and space issues, as well as the appointment, reappointment, promotion and tenure processes for faculty. He also was actively engaged in the universitys technology commercialization activities, the growing internationalization of the universitys global footprint and the role of technology in education. Dr. Kamlet earned his bachelors degree in mathematics from Stanford University, and a masters degree in mathematical statistics and Ph.D. in economics from the University of California at Berkeley. 1991 - 2000: Paul Christiano Paul Christiano spent most of his academic and professional career at Carnegie Mellon. He earned all of his civil engineering degrees from the university; after a brief period elsewhere, he returned to campus as an associate professor. He became a full professor in 1981, then served as associate dean of the College of Engineering from 1982-86, head of the Civil Engineering Department from 1986-88, and dean of the college from 1989-91. President Mehrabian named him provost in 1991. Christiano worked to strengthen all academic and research units and helped lead an educational movement at the university that fostered the growth of cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary education and research on campus. He stimulated the creation of new research programs that involved the collaboration of faculty and researchers across multiple academic units, specifically among the arts, engineering and computer science. Of particular importance to Christiano was his work with the Small Undergraduate Research Grant program, which allowed young scholars and scientists to explore their own areas of interest and hone their skills as researchers. He was also an advocate of technology-enhanced learning, and as provost he helped to establish the Technology Enhanced Learning Lab (now the Office of Technology for Education) to assist faculty in their use of technology to improve the education process. Christiano was at the center of strategic investments in each of the university's academic units, and his work enabled Carnegie Mellon's reputation to soar to its highest level in history. Christiano helped to establish the Office of Technology Transfer (now the Innovation Transfer Center) and the positions of vice provost for education and research. During his tenure, he also served as acting dean of the College of Fine Arts (1992-93) and the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (1995-96), as well as acting vice president for development (1999-2000). 1983 - 1991: Angel Jordan Angel Jordan joined the Carnegie Mellon community in 1956 as an instructor and doctoral student in Electrical Engineering. In the next two decades, Jordan rose through the faculty ranks, eventually becoming the Whitaker Professor of Electrical Engineering in 1972 and dean of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now College of Engineering) in 1979. While he was provost, Jordan took a leadership role in attracting the Software Engineering Institute to Carnegie Mellon and in helping to establish the School of Computer Science. Undergraduate enrollment continued to grow and graduate enrollment nearly doubled between 1968 and 1988. The university also saw a major increase in sponsored research, and advisory boards were created to ensure that departments were giving their students the best education possible. The university thrived while Jordan was provost, attracting the brightest faculty members from the best universities in the nation. Their research helped place Carnegie Mellon among the United States' most prominent research institutions. In July 2003, Jordan was appointed acting director and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI). (Reference: Carnegie Mellon: A Centennial History , Carnegie Mellon University Press, Pittsburgh.) 1983 - 1991: John P. Crecine President Cyert named Crecine senior vice president for academic affairs, which had equal rank with provost but with separate duties. He served alongside Provost Angel Jordan. In his role, Crecine was responsible for administrating academic and policy, planning and budgeting, and was a strong supporter of the expansion of computer usage throughout campus. Prior to his appointment to senior vice president, he served as dean of CMU's newly-formed College of Humanities and Social Sciences, from 1976 - 1983. Under his leadership, Crecine transformed the college by launching its general education curriculum, and the Philosophy and the Social and Decision Sciences departments. He also guided the English department's transition to its current three-concentration model, and supported the continuation of the Computer Science and Statistics departments, which were originally not housed under a specific college. Throughout his time as dean, Crecine led with a focus on interdisciplinary learning and delivering excellence in selected domains of comparative advantage, which are hallmarks of a CMU education. After Crecine left Carnegie Mellon, he became president of Georgia Institute of Technology, where he founded its College of Computing, replicating the novel structures and approaches that had taken hold at Carnegie Mellon. 1981 - 1983: Daniel B. Berg and Richard Van Horn President Cyert continued to have two provosts in the 1980s. Berg joined the university from Westinghouse and, prior to becoming provost, served as dean of the Mellon College of Science. As dean, Berg was instrumental in fostering support from the university's department heads for creating the Robotics Institute. He also helped recruit the institute's first faculty and students. After three years as provost, Berg left Carnegie Mellon to serve as provost at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he later became president. Van Horn originally came from the faculty of the business school and also served as vice president of business affairs. Van Horn was in good stead with the faculty and personally visited every department during his tenure to hear criticism and explain priorities. He also strove to make computing accessible for everyone. Together with professors Herbert Simon and Alan Newell, Van Horn convinced President Cyert that a campus network of personal computers could be a valuable tool for the university community. Van Horn and Cyert approached IBM with a proposal to become partners in the Carnegie Mellon's Andrew Computing Network, the first networking venture on a university campus. Today, Carnegie Mellon has one of the "most wired" and "wireless" computing networks in the world. After he left Carnegie Mellon, Van Horn went on to serve as president at both the University of Houston and the University of Oklahoma. While Berg and Van Horn served as provosts, the University Teaching Center and Information Technology Center were established. Carnegie Mellon also became a leader in computer technology. 1973 - 1980: Arnold Weber Weber served as provost for the College of Humanities and Social Sciences (now Dietrich College), the School of Urban and Public Affairs (now Heinz College) and the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now the Tepper School of Business). He was also dean of the business school but resigned from the position in 1977 to concentrate on the provost's role. He left Carnegie Mellon in 1980 to become president at Northwestern University. 1964 - 1981: Edward Schatz From 1964 through 1973, Carnegie Mellon did not have a university provost, per se. Instead, President Warner created the position of vice president for academic affairs and chose Edward Schatz to fill that position. As vice president for academic affairs, Schatz led and coordinated the development and improvement of the university's total education program. He played key roles in the merger with the Mellon Institute of Research and in creating the School of Urban and Public Affairs (now Heinz College). The university changed dramatically during Schatz' tenure. The College of Engineering was divided into the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the Mellon College of Science. Margaret Morrison Carnegie College was phased out over the course of several years, and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences (now Dietrich College) was created with departments in English, History, Modern Languages and Psychology. Wean Hall and Warner Hall were constructed, and the student body continued to expand. Faculty members formed the Faculty Senate in 1968 to address major campus issues. In 1973, President Cyert officially reinstituted the Office of the Provost but split the office between two individuals, Schatz and Arnold Weber. Under Cyert, Schatz oversaw all educational matters in the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now College of Engineering) and the College of Fine Arts. Schatz served as interim university president for a short time in 1972 before Cyert took office. While Schatz was provost, the university continued to grow. The Robotics Institute opened and Carnegie Mellon celebrated its first Nobel Laureate, Herb Simon, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978. Schatz was instrumental in bringing the first computers to Carnegie Mellon and encouraged the growth of technology on campus. After serving as provost, Schatz became senior vice president of the university and oversaw large building projects, like the $47 million University Center.

During his tenure as provost, Smith played a large role in developing the Carnegie Plan of Professional Education  the institute's pioneering model of education designed to develop in students the character and ability needed to help them think independently about all aspects of their professional, social and private responsibilities. The curriculum was divided into two parts, scientific and humanistic-social. Engineering and Science students were required to take about one quarter of their classes in the humanistic and social sciences. All courses employed CIT's unique problem-solving focus. Smith also regarded examining and improving undergraduate teaching as his chief objective and was instrumental in founding the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now Tepper School of Business) in 1949. When he retired in 1958, the Board of Trustees commended Smith for his significant contributions to the university through his leadership during the development of a liberal professional education program.
