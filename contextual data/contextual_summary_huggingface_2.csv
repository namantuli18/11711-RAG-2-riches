Thousands fleeing persecution and expulsions across Western Europe came. As Poland expanded to the east and south, Jews moved into Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian lands. By 1800 there were more than a million Jews in the Pale. By 1900, they would number nearly five million. Jews flourished in the Pale, creating diverse religious, cultural, educational, and charitable institutions. Then, between 1881 and 1914 over two million left all that they had known for the West. This talk discusses how the Pale came to be, life in it and why this mass migration occurred. It breaks the 120-year history of the Pale into periods of creation, confinement, repression, enlightenment, pogroms, and chaos. There is much more to the story than the horrific pogroms at the turn of the 20th century. Additional brief talk, “My 5th Great Grandfather’s Name” The oldest family documentation that I have found is the 1850 Russian Revision List (census) for Dubno which lists my 3rd great-grandfather (who had died in 1848) and my 2nd great-grandfather (who, as a young man, was now head of the family). Unlike censuses, revision lists included information on residents who had died since the previous revision list. Based on the patronymic middle name of my 3rd great-grandfather, I had the name, if nothing more, of my 4th great-grandfather. The records office in Dubno, where the Bookbinders lived, was destroyed during World War II and all records contained there were lost. The regional archive in Rivne has no earlier records. So far as I know, no records exist for my 5th great-grandfather. So, I developed a hypothesis as to his name and the approximate dates of his birth and death. You might use the technique that I employed to do the same when no records can be found. This program is possible through the generous support of the William M.

Lacy (Zoe Ziegler), navigating the summer vacation between fifth and sixth grade, yearns to—but also fears to—escape the orbit of her mother Janet (Julianne Nicholson, Mare of Easttown ) as she leaves childhood. It’s been just the two of them, you see, but then three satellites enter, then leave, the picture: Will Patton ( Wendy and Lucy ) as an aspiring boyfriend, Sophie Okonedo ( Hotel Rwanda ) as an old friend, and Elias Koteas ( Exotica ) as the head of a spacey theatre troupe. The screenplay gestated in Baker’s mind and heart for decades—“It was kind of the first idea for a movie I ever had,” she revealed—drawing deeply on the milieu she grew up in, the woods of western Massachusetts. Nicholson did too, though not until they met during casting did the two discover their childhood proximity (“We shopped at the same stores and swam in the same ponds,” Baker said in an interview). No score, just nature sounds, keeps the focus entirely on the mother and daughter in this hyper-subtle character study; sound designer Paul Hsu has said Janet Planet was the quietest movie he’s ever worked on. Directed by Annie Baker 2023 | USA, United Kingdom | English language | DCP Rated PG-13 Online sales end 15 minutes prior to showtime.

This phenomenon offers an opportunity to gain insight into biological resilience. Of outstanding interest is our observation that in humans such survival response is mounted following “slow” but not “fast” (traumatic) death. Our work helps understand the ways in which cells and tissues, and the genes in them, strive for life even as the body dies. About Chandan K. Sen Dr. Chandan K.

The presentation will include online sources and documents not yet online for both the United States and Europe; she will also cover some basic knowledge critical to researching one’s Jewish roots. 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. Break (no lunch provided) Second Session 1 p.m.-3 p.m. “Defying Expectations: The Story of a Jewish Woman Who Took on the Russian Empire.” Chava Lefand (1797-1884) lived in a time when we’d expect a woman to not be well-represented in documentation. And in fact, looking at traditional genealogical documents gives little information about Chava and the life she lived. But Chava’s story shows how much can be learned by looking at non-traditional documentation to learn about an individual and the context in which they lived. Chava had already lost two children to mandatory conscription into the Russian Empire, and she refused to lose another. The widowed mother filed a series of petitions throughout the 1850s which went as high as two Czars and the Governing Senate (the Russian Empire’s Supreme Court equivalent). In doing this, she generated a genealogical gold mine (telling of secret marriages and here various relatives were living or hiding from the draft) and gave her perspective on family and community gossip and conflict. While this is the talk about one woman (the speaker’s 5th great grandmother), her hundreds of pages of petitions and appeals tell her perspective of how Jewish families dealt with mandatory conscription of their young children, how conscription caused strife within the Jewish community and formed a hierarchy (she felt she wasn’t part of the cool kids’ clique), and how relatively simple Jewish families were able to generate a significant amount of documentation in the mid-1800s. This program is possible through the generous support of the William M. Lowenstein Genealogical Research Endowment Fund of the Jewish Community Foundation. “Jewish Genealogy Day” is a collaboration between the Jewish Genealogy Society of Pittsburgh and the Rauh Jewish Archives at the Heinz History Center. Please register online. The program is free for JGS-Pittsburgh members. Non-members can attend one session for $10 or both session for $18, which includes a free one-year membership to the JGS.

Having spent last spring and early summer with his taking-it-to-the-roots I Go Back 2023 Tour of those arenas and markets where he rose to major headlining status, the only country artist to be on Billboard ’s Top 10 Touring Artists of the Last 25 Years for the past 14 years is bringing old friends and new to 18 full-scale stadiums with a few more major surprises to come. Joining Chesney is the multiple GRAMMY-winning Zac Brown Band , enjoying their 12th CMA Group of the Year nomination; 2023 CMA Song of the Year and New Artist nominee Megan Moroney ; and multiple-week No. 1 “When The Sun Goes Down” duet partner Uncle Kracker , known for his own hits “Follow Me” and “Drift Away.” “I wanted a name that suggested – obviously – when all the good stuff starts to happen. The one thing I’ve learned about No Shoes Nation and these stadium shows is they start the good times early and they just keep it going,” Chesney says of his 2024 tour name. “But we all know, when the sun goes down, that’s when people really get loose and enjoy themselves. “That was the thing about Kracker and my song. It captured a vibe and a moment so perfectly. No matter how much fun you’re having all day long, ‘ everything gets hotter when the sun goes down...’ I know from years of experience that’s true. “So, I can’t wait to get back out there, stadium-sized ’cause there’s nothing like 60,000 members of No Shoes Nation singing these songs. It’s gonna be awesome.” Kicking off April 20, 2024 at Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium, the tour will run through August 23 at Foxborough, Mass.’s Gillette Stadium for what has become a tradition: closing out the tour in a venue Chesney has played to well over a million people. Tickets for these major stadium shows will go on-sale next Friday, Nov. 17. “Zac Brown Band understands high-energy country, the same way Alabama did, and they’ve got our friend Caroline Jones in their line-up now, too,” Chesney says of the group joining as direct support. “Megan Moroney isn’t just one of the smart new voices in country, she’s really bringing a sense of heart and joy to the music – and I’m fired up to be bringing her out to No Shoes Nation. “And Uncle Kracker has been part of so many fun times, crazy moments and memories made, it always kicks things up a notch when he’s out there with us. So, it really is old friends, new friends and a whole lotta love.” Again presented by Blue Chair Bay® Rum, the Sun Goes Down 2024 Tour brings all the high velocity energy and songs people know by heart back to America’s favorite stadiums.

See 3 or more Capra films (including the documentary) and recieve a discount, AND free popcorn at each of the screenings! Made during the Great Depression and just before World War II, this sharp-edged comedy marked a turning point for director Frank Capra from optimism to a more ambivalent vision. It celebrates democracy and the difference one determined man can make (decades before the “deep state” entered the parlance), but depicts a Washington so deeply compromised by vested interests that some feared the film might be used as fascist propaganda. In fact, it was banned in Nazi Germany. Mr Smith Goes to Washington belongs to James Stewart as the goofy, stuttering dreamer. The role, originally intended for Gary Cooper, made him a star. Claude Rains also impresses as a politician who has abdicated his youthful ideals, while Jean Arthur is memorable as Stewart’s savvy, cynical Girl Friday. From special appointments to legislative proceedings, the 1939 film was one of the first films preserved by the Library of Congress because it was considered so “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.” Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, it only won one as it faced-off against Gone with the Wind , The Wizard of Oz and Goodbye, Mr Chips .

While the case ended legal school segregation and declared separate educational facilities to be inherently unequal, the court did not guide the implementation of Brown v. Broad and left its enforcement to school districts. Ten years later, in 1964, the Civil Rights Act was signed, prohibiting discrimination in public places and employment. Civil Rights assisted in forcing the issue of removing discrimination, yet it did not provide a clear framework for school implementation for students or increasing minority hiring practices in the classroom. The execution of the ruling was met with resistance nationwide and led to challenges that continue to affect schools seventy years later. During this commemorative program, educators will discuss issues that stemmed from the decision and share resources and information on how to advocate for public education today. Current high school students and recent graduates will then present on a variety of topics affecting education to give attendees a sense of how the landmark decision has impacted schools for the last 70 years.

This documentary uses previously unseen archive to examine Capra’s story and unpick his complex relationship with America. We hear in his own words how he fought to escape his Italian American roots and eventually made his way to Hollywood in the early years of the studio system. The film offers a candid portrait of a complicated man whose stories of hope in troubled times continue to speak to audiences today. Despite his humble beginnings, by the 1930s Frank Capra was perhaps the most successful and influential film director in the world. Today we still use the term Capra-esque to describe his particular kind of storytelling. But more than that, Capra’s films spoke to a public that was wearied by world events. The Great Depression was devastating lives, World War II was around the corner, and Capra’s movies were seen by many as a balm in troubled times. His films brought audiences together and offered a vision of America where ideals win out, decency triumphs and ordinary people have their day. Directed by Matthew Wells 2024 | USA | English language | DCP Rated PG-13 Online sales end 15 minutes prior to showtime.

Then she learns about ‘The Substance’: a mysterious injection that “unlocks your DNA”, birthing a young, gorgeous version of yourself from your own spine. Of course, there’s a catch: every seven days, one body heads out into the world while the other enters recuperative stasis. So when Elisabeth’s ambitious younger self refuses to surrender her newfound fame, the elder begins paying the price… with a gruesome physical disintegration. In a daringly deranged lead performance, Moore leans in to Elisabeth’s professional self-loathing with zeal. And as her rebellious clone, Margaret Qualley ( Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ) matches the mayhem at every turn, while the cast that includes Dennis Quaid revels in going ham with the film’s outrageous premise.

Coined as an avant-anarcho ecosatire, the film envisions a post-apocalyptic landscape strewn with electronic detritus and suffering the toxic repercussions of mass marketing in a high-tech commodity culture. “Kill” is Dutch for stream, FRESH KILL tells the story of two young lesbian parents caught up in a global exchange of industrial waste via contaminated sushi. The place is New York and the time is now! Raw fish lips are the rage on trendy menus across Manhattan. A ghost barge, bearing nuclear refuse, circles the planet in search of a willing port. Household pets start to glow ominously and then disappear altogether. The sky opens up and snows soap flakes. People start speaking in dangerous tongues. A riveting and densely packed film, FRESH KILL evokes the furious rhythms of channel surfing with its rapid-fire editing style. ABOUT THE ARTIST: Born in Taiwan and now based in Paris, Shu Lea Cheang is an artist and filmmaker whose work aims to re-envision genders, genres, and operating structures. She began her career as a member of activist media collectives Paper Tiger TV and Deep Dish TV. Later, as a celebrated pioneer of Net Art, her work Brandon (1998–99) became the first-ever web-based artwork commissioned and collected by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Since 1994, she has produced four feature films, FRESH KILL (1994), I.K.U. (2000), FLUIDØ (2017), and UKI (2023), which encompass a new genre she calls “Scifi New Queer Cinema.” In 2019, she represented Taiwan at the Venice Biennale with the mixed media installation, 3x3x6. Over the years, Cheang has participated in many renowned international biennials, including Performa 19, New York; the 11th Taipei Biennial; the 50th and 58th Venice Biennale; and the 1992 and 1994 Whitney Biennials among others.

Ani DiFranco crashed onto the music scene in the early ‘90s, a thundering new voice in the cultural wilderness, unapologetically bisexual, political and feminist. She toured relentlessly, thrashing out hundreds of frenzied shows that were part mosh pit, part hootenanny and part full-on tent revival, then selling cassette tapes from the trunk of her car to make it to the next gig. Ani became a worldwide phenomenon when she beat the male-dominated music industry at its own game by founding Righteous Babe Records, the first “woman-run non-corporate queer-happy” label, still going strong after nearly 35 years. The press called her “an entrepreneurial wonder” and “the industry’s worst nightmare.” Prince called her “my hero.” Ani simply called herself a folk singer, dedicated to art, activism and staying true to herself, no matter the cost. 1-800-ON-HER-OWN takes us on a wild cinematic road trip, from DiFranco’s punk-folk past to her life today as she reinvents herself as a passionate activist and revered rock star. Throughout the ride, she’s brutally honest, famously foul-mouthed and totally hilarious.

Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts “The Rainbow Club,” Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated.  Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes.

For nearly five years, Herzog desperately tried to complete one of the most ambitious and difficult films of his career, Fitzcarraldo, the story of one man’s attempt to build an opera house deep in the Amazon jungle.

The result is an extraordinary document of the filmmaking process and a unique look into the single-minded mission of one of cinema’s most fearless directors. Blank’s interviews with Hersog, bring context and backstory to his personalized style of “ethnographic filmmaking,” which values Peru’s native, Campa, Machiguenga, and Aguaruna people and their Old World culture as much as it does Herzog’s perilous enterprise.

Following Q&A with Vidak, we'll screen ARIEL (1988) by Aki Kaurismäki. In a small village in Finland, which has relied solely on metallurgical activities for the past two centuries, Aki Kaurismäki and his friend, the poet and writer Mika Lätti, are constructing their own cinema within an old foundry. Employing recycled wood, metal, and pre-owned furniture, Kaurismäki and the residents of Karkkila collaboratively craft Kino Laika. The venue is surrounded by Cadillacs, motorcycles, rock bars, and the awe-inspiring beauty of nature, encapsulating the very essence of cinema’s enchantment – a place where the magic resides in its profound capacity to instigate change. In chronicling the creation of Kino Laika, Croatian-French filmmaker Veljko Vidak has created a modest yet finely-crafted film that is simultaneously a documentary about a particular cultural project, a more wide-ranging filmic meditation on the nature of cinema, and a portrait of a small-town community. Transcending the usual documentary trappings, CINEMA LAIKA radiates a deadpan charm and bemused curiosity about humanity that calls to mind nothing so much as the work of Kaurismäki himself. About Ariel: In Kaurismäki’s drolly existential crime drama, a coal miner named Taisto attempts to leave behind a provincial life of inertia and economic despair, only to get into ever deeper trouble. Yet a minor-key romance with a hilariously dispassionate meter maid might provide a light at the end of a very dark tunnel. ARIEL, which boasts a terrific soundtrack of Finnish tango and Baltic pop music and lovely cinematography by Kaurismäki’s longtime cameraman Timo Salmimen, put its director on the international map.

This special screening includes two classics directed by and starring Buster Keaton, and both with live accompaniment! First up is SHERLOCK JR (1924) with a live piano score by Tom Roberts: Keaton’s classic about a lovestruck projectionist who falls asleep during a show and dreams he has entered the film as a detective is a delightful and ingenious comedy. Sherlock Jr. is a high point of silent cinema, featuring one of Keaton’s cleverest conceits, and doubling as a reflection on cinema itself. About Tom Roberts: Tom Roberts is one of the leading scholars of early jazz piano in the world today (as stated by Ricardo Sciavales in The Heart and Soul of Stride, Blues, and Swing Piano). He has performed on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, The Statler Brothers Show on TNN, and A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor. Tom was pianist for Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks in New York City and pianist and musical director for Leon Redbone for six years. Tom has recorded over 40 compact discs and has performed throughout the United States and Europe. And then our second film, THE NAVIGATOR (1924), with a live score by The Pittsburgh Film Orchestra: In this revered silent comedy, the wealthy and impulsive Rollo Treadway (Buster Keaton) decides to propose to his beautiful socialite neighbor, Betsy O'Brien (Kathryn McGuire). Alhough Betsy turns Rollo down, he still opts to go on the cruise that he intended as their honeymoon. When circumstances find both Rollo and Betsy on the wrong ship, they end up having adventures on the high seas, allowing Keaton plenty of opportunities to display his trademark agility. About the Pittsburgh Film Orchestra: The Pittsburgh Film Orchestra began life in 2007 as the Ivy Leaf Orchestra, an ensemble formed to provide live musical accompaniment for silent films. Our first performance was for the 1917 Douglas Fairbanks feature, A Modern Musketeer. Since then the Pittsburgh Film Orchestra has provided music for a wide variety of classic comedies and dramatic films. The ensemble utilizes music published between 1885 and 1930, including hundreds of compositions specifically written for theatre orchestras and movie accompaniment. We call ourselves an orchestra even though by modern standards we’re really a chamber ensemble because that was the tradition in the silent era; as long as you had at least two instrumentalists, you had an orchestra! The PFO is a flexible ensemble (ranging from 2 to 22 players), and the ensemble emulates the best aspects of film accompaniment from the silent era to provide an emotionally and aesthetically satisfying viewing experience.

New York, 1944–1985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films—all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York’s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol’s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum’s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby’s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L’Amico Fried’s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby’s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy."", 'event_name': 'Roger Jacoby: Pittsburgh Stories'}",combined_events,"Wood Street Galleries presents the world premiere of three newly restored experimental films by Roger Jacoby, a pivotal figure in gay experimental filmmaking, from October 2024 to January 2025."

A city of hills, parks, and valleys, it is the centre of an urban industrial complex that includesthe surrounding cities of Aliquippa (northwest), New Kensington (northeast), McKeesport (southeast), andWashington (southwest) and the borough of Wilkinsburg (east).

The conﬂict between theBritish and French over territorial claims in the area was settled in 1758 when General John Forbes and hisBritish and colonial army expelled the French from Fort Duquesne (built 1754). Forbes named the site for theBritish statesman William Pitt the Elder. The British built Fort Pitt (1761) to ensure their dominance at the sourceof the Ohio. Settlers began arriving after Native American forces led by Ottawa chief Pontiac were defeated in1763; an agreement subsequently was made between Native American groups and the Penn family, and aboundary dispute was ended between Pennsylvania and Virginia. Pittsburgh was laid out (1764) by JohnCampbell in the area around the fort (now the Golden Triangle). Following the American Revolution, the townbecame an outﬁtting point for settlers traveling westward down the Ohio River.Pittsburgh’s strategic location and wealth of natural resourcesspurred its commercial and industrial growth in the 19th century. Ablast furnace, erected by George Anschutz about 1792, was theforerunner of the iron and steel industry that for more than a centurywas the city’s economic mainstay; by 1850 Pittsburgh was known asthe “Iron City.” The Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad,both completed in 1834, opened vital markets for trade and shipping.The city suffered a great loss in 1845 when some 24 blocks ofbusinesses, homes, churches, and other buildings were destroyed byﬁre.After the American Civil War, great numbers of Europeanimmigrants swelled Pittsburgh’s population, and industrial magnatessuch as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and Thomas Mellonbuilt their steel empires there. The city became the focus of historicfriction between labour and management, and the AmericanFederation of Labor was born there in 1881.

Growthcontinued nearly unabated through World War II, the war yearsbringing a particularly great boon for the economy. The populationcrested at more than 675,000 in 1950, after which it steadilydeclined; by the end of the century, it had returned almost to the1900 level. Most citizens were still of European ancestry, but thegrowing African American proportion of the population exceededone-fourth. During the period of economic and population growth,Pittsburgh had come to epitomize the grimy, polluted industrial city.After the war, however, the city undertook an extensiveredevelopment program that emphasized smoke-pollution control,ﬂood prevention, and sewage disposal. In 1957 it became the ﬁrstAmerican city to generate electricity by nuclear power.The contemporary cityBy the late 1970s and early ’80s, the steel industry had virtuallydisappeared—a result of foreign competition and decreased demand.Many of the surrounding mill towns were laid to waste byunemployment, becoming a symbol of the notorious Rust Belt, theU.S. region where steelmaking and manufacturing once thrivedbefore succumbing to widespread unemployment and poverty.Pittsburgh, however, successfully diversiﬁed its economy throughmore emphasis on light industries—though metalworking,chemicals, and plastics remained important—and on such high-technology industries as computer software, industrial automation(robotics), and biomedical and environmental technologies.Numerous industrial research laboratories were established in the area, and the service sector became increasinglyimportant. Pittsburgh long has been one of the nation’s largest inland ports, and it remains a leading transportationcentre.Much of the Golden Triangle has been rebuilt and includes PointState Park (containing Fort Pitt Blockhouse and Fort Pitt Museum),the Gateway Center (site of several skyscrapers and a garden), andthe David L. Lawrence Convention Center. The University ofPittsburgh was chartered in 1787. Other educational institutionsinclude Carnegie Mellon (1900), Duquesne (1878), Point Park(1960), Chatham (1869), and Carlow (1929) universities and twocampuses of the Community College of Allegheny County (1966).

Its museums include those forthe ﬁne arts and natural history (both founded in 1895), the CarnegieScience Center (1991), which now also houses the Henry Buhl, Jr.,Planetarium and Observatory (1939), and the Andy Warhol Museum(1994), which exhibits the works of the Pittsburgh-born artist andﬁlmmaker. Other institutions afﬁliated with the organization are theCarnegie Library of Pittsburgh, which contains more than 3.3 millionvolumes, and the Carnegie Music Hall. The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performs at Heinz Hall, a restoredmovie theatre.Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens (1893), which covers 15 acres (6 hectares), is noted for its extensivegreenhouses. The city’s zoo, in the northeastern Highland Park neighbourhood, includes an aquarium. Two newsports venues opened in 2001 on the north bank of the Allegheny opposite the Golden Triangle: PNC Park ishome of the Pirates, the city’s professional baseball team, and Acrisure Stadium houses the Steelers, itsprofessional football team.

"Pittsburgh PenguinsPittsburgh Penguins, American professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Penguinshave won the Stanley Cup ﬁve times (1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017).Founded during the 1967 National Hockey League (NHL) expansion, the Penguins took their name from theigloolike appearance of Mellon Arena, where the team played from its inception through the 2009–10 season.After ﬁnding moderate success in the 1970s and then struggling throughout the early 1980s, the Penguins draftedMario Lemieux in 1984, who was an instant offensive force on the ice and would become one of the greatestplayers in the history of the game. As the club drafted and traded for other standout players, the Penguins becamea regular presence in the playoffs in the late 1980s. After the addition of right wing Jaromir Jagr, they won boththe 1991 and 1992 Stanley Cup championships.In 1993 team captain Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkin disease; however, he overcame the disease and notonly returned to the team after a year off but also led the league in goals during the 1995–96 season. FollowingLemieux’s initial retirement in 1997, Jagr became team captain and won the league scoring title four years in arow (from 1997–98 to 2000–01).The Penguins franchise struggled ﬁnancially, and the team ﬁled for bankruptcy in 1998. The following yearLemieux converted years of unpaid salary to equity and became a part owner of the team. In 2000 he leftretirement and became the ﬁrst player-owner in the history of the NHL before retiring again midway through the2005–06 season.In 2005 a new Penguins era began with the drafting of Sidney Crosby, who in 2006–07 was the NHL’s leadingscorer and, at age 19, became the youngest team captain in NHL history. In the 2007–08 season Crosby andsecond-year star Evgeni Malkin led the Penguins to the Stanley Cup ﬁnals, which they lost to the Detroit RedWings. The following season Malkin led the NHL in points while Crosby ﬁnished third. That year the Penguinsﬁnished fourth in the Atlantic Division but advanced again to the Stanley Cup ﬁnals, this time defeating the RedWings in seven games.In the six seasons after the 2009 Stanley Cup win, Pittsburgh remained one of the best teams in the NHL, runningoff a franchise record three straight seasons with at least 100 points (a team receives two points for a victory, onefor an overtime loss, and none for a regulation loss) between 2009–10 and 2011–12 and winning three divisiontitles. However, the team failed to advance past the conference ﬁnals over that span, losing to a lower-seeded teamin ﬁve of the six postseasons. The team broke through in 2015–16, ending the regular season on a hot streak thatcarried over into the postseason, during which the Penguins captured another Stanley Cup title (over the San JoseSharks in six games). The Penguins tallied the second most points in the NHL (111) in 2016–17, and in thepostseason the team won seven-game series in both the second round and Eastern Conference ﬁnals to return tothe Stanley Cup ﬁnals, where they faced the Nashville Predators. The Penguins then defeated the Predators in sixgames, becoming the ﬁrst NHL team to win consecutive Stanley Cups since 1998. Pittsburgh returned to the
playoffs in 2018 but lost in the second round, and in 2019 the team was swept in its ﬁrst-round series. The nexttwo NHL seasons were shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Penguins failed to advance past thequalifying round of the 2019–20 playoffs, and the following year the team lost in the ﬁrst round of the postseason.Adam Augustyn",Pittsburgh Penguins,"The Pittsburgh Penguins are an American professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, known for their five Stanley Cup championships."

Hisbenefactions made possible the building of the NationalGallery of Art in Washington, D.C.After completing his studies at Western University (now theUniversity of Pittsburgh), Mellon entered his father’s banking house in 1874 and proved so capablethat in 1882 his father transferred the bank’s ownership to him. In the next three decades Mellonbuilt up a financial-industrial empire by supplying capital for Pittsburgh-based corporations toexpand in such fields as aluminum, steel, oil, coal, coke, and synthetic abrasives. Mellon’s keenjudgment of new technologies and potentially successful firms and entrepreneurs enabled him tohelp found the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) and the Gulf Oil Corporation. In alliancewith Henry Clay Frick, he helped found the Union Steel Company, which later merged with UnitedStates Steel Corporation. He and Frick were also the principal organizers (in 1889) of the UnionTrust Company, which became Mellon’s principal financial instrument and acquired his family’sbank. By the early 1920s Mellon had become one of the richest men in the United States.Mellon was appointed to head the U.S. Treasury by Pres. Warren G. Harding in 1921. In discussionsconcerning reduction of the national debt, which totaled about $26 billion in 1920 as a result ofWorld War I expenditures, Mellon held that continuance of the high wartime tax rates woulddiscourage business expansion and hence reduce revenue. He also advocated reduction of the surtaxrates on incomes. Largely through his efforts Congress repealed the excess-profits tax and graduallylowered the income tax rate until in 1926 the maximum surtax was reduced from 50 to 20 percent.Further reductions in tax rates were later made; by June 30, 1928, the national debt had fallen toIn Full: Andrew William MellonBorn:March 24, 1855, Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania, U.S.Died:August 26, 1937, Southampton,New York (aged 82)Founder:National Gallery of ArtHousehold FinanceInvestingTradingRetirementCompaniesBiographiesFinanc

Steinberg continued Reiner’s work of building the PSO into one ofthe ﬁnest orchestras in the United States, expanding its repertoire to include music from the Baroque periodthrough such central European modernists as Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, Anton Webern, and Gustav Mahler.Under Previn and Maazel the PSO made international tours and championed English, Russian, and late 20th-century music. From the 1960s the orchestra made successful tours of Europe, Asia, and South America. The PSOoffered community outreach programs, children’s concerts, and great-performers series.

"Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw.The Immaculate ReceptionThe Immaculate ReceptionPittsburgh SteelersPittsburgh Steelers, American professional gridiron footballteam based in Pittsburgh that plays in the NFL. One of the league’s most successful and storied franchises, theSteelers have won six Super Bowl titles and eight American Football Conference (AFC) championships.Originally called the Pittsburgh Pirates, the team was founded in 1933 by Pittsburgh resident Art Rooney, whoallegedly used winnings from a wager on a horse race to establish the franchise. (Ownership of the team remainswithin the Rooney family to this day.) The team was not an early success; it qualiﬁed for the playoffs just once inits ﬁrst 37 years. In 1940 the team changed its nickname to “Steelers” in tribute to Pittsburgh’s main industry atthe time. The Steelers tied for the NFL Eastern Division title in 1947, but they were shut out 21–0 by thePhiladelphia Eagles in a playoff match to qualify for the NFL championship game. Rooney watched the Steelersstruggle through the 1950s and ’60s until their fortunes turned around with the arrival of head coach Chuck Nollin 1969.From 1969 to 1972 Noll showcased his amazing skill atrecognizing talent as he drafted ﬁve future Hall of Famers:defensive tackle “Mean” Joe Greene, quarterback TerryBradshaw, defensive back Mel Blount, linebacker Jack Ham,and running back Franco Harris (remembered for his“Immaculate Reception,” a game-winning catch in theplayoffs against the Oakland Raiders in 1972, one of themost remarkable and controversial plays in professionalfootball history). In 1974 Noll selected four more players who would eventually be inducted into the Hall ofFame: center Mike Webster, receivers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth, and linebacker Jack Lambert. Theseplayers went on to form a dynasty of unmatched success, winning four Super Bowls (1975, 1976, 1979, and1980) in six seasons behind a dominant defense known as the “Steel Curtain” and an efﬁcient offense led byBradshaw. The Steelers teams of the 1970s were also characterized by a fervent fan base, notable for the brightyellow “Terrible Towels”—which were created by the team’s popular and idiosyncratic radio broadcaster for 35years, Myron Cope—that fans would wave during home games. Pittsburgh faded slightly in the 1980s, with fourpostseason berths in the decade, and Noll retired in 1991.Noll was replaced by Bill Cowher, who led the Steelers to the playoffs in 10 of his 15 seasons with the team. Oneof Cowher’s most signiﬁcant personnel moves was his promotion of secondary coach Dick LeBeau to the positionof defensive coordinator in 1995: in his two stints (1995–97, 2004–15) as the Steelers’ coordinator, LeBeau puttogether formidable defenses that deﬁned the Pittsburgh teams of those eras. The Steelers’ defense of the mid-1990s was highlighted by stars such as future Hall of Fame cornerback Rod Woodson and linebackers Greg Lloydand Kevin Greene. Pittsburgh advanced to the Super Bowl in 1996 but lost to the Dallas Cowboys.
Troy PolamaluPittsburgh Steelers safety TroyPolamalu, 2007.The Steelers continued their success into the new century, and in2006—with a team featuring quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, widereceiver Hines Ward, and safety Troy Polamalu—they defeated theSeattle Seahawks to gain a ﬁfth Super Bowl title. In 2009 theSteelers, under the leadership of second-year head coach MikeTomlin, beat the Arizona Cardinals in dramatic fashion to capturetheir record sixth Super Bowl championship. After missing theplayoffs following the 2009 regular season, Pittsburgh captured itsthird AFC championship in a six-year span in 2011 to earn a berth inSuper Bowl XLV, a loss to the Green Bay Packers.The Steelers returned to the playoffs after both the 2011 and 2014 regular seasons, but the team lost in theopening round of each postseason. Pittsburgh won its ﬁrst playoff game following the 2015 season but waseliminated by the Denver Broncos in the divisional round. The team won 11 games the following year andadvanced to the playoffs, where the Steelers lost to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in the AFCchampionship game for the third time. Pittsburgh topped that regular-season performance in 2017 with 13 wins,which tied with three other teams for the most in the NFL. However, the Steelers were upset in the team’s openingplayoff game. In 2018 the team went 9–6–1 while enduring a number of high-proﬁle public spats among many ofits best players, missing the postseason for the ﬁrst time in ﬁve years.From 2019 to 2023 the Steelers continued their reliably solid, if unspectacular, play under the steady leadership ofTomlin, who, since he joined the team in 2007, has never ﬁnished a season with fewer than eight wins. A strongdefense was a hallmark of the team, led by linebacker T.J. Watt, a perennial Defensive Player of the Year ﬁnalist(he won the award in 2021). Pittsburgh made the playoffs after the 2020, 2021, and 2023 seasons, each timelosing in the wild card round.Adam Augustyn",Pittsburgh Steelers,"The Pittsburgh Steelers, led by legendary quarterback Terry Bradshaw and later by head coach Chuck Noll, achieved six Super Bowl titles and eight AFC championships."
"Roberto ClementePuerto Rican baseball player RobertoClemente, 1968.Pittsburgh PiratesPittsburgh Pirates, American professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Sometimes referredto as the “Bucs,” the Pirates are among the oldest teams in baseball and have won the World Series ﬁve times(1909, 1925, 1960, 1971, and 1979).The team that would become the Pirates was founded as the Pittsburgh Alleghenys in 1882 and played in theAmerican Association before moving to the National League (NL) in 1887. League ofﬁcials accused theAlleghenys of using “piratical” tactics to steal talented players from opposing teams, and the ball club embracedthe label and in 1891 ofﬁcially adopted the name Pirates.Shortstop and Pittsburgh-area native Honus Wagner was among the team’s early standouts, playing with thePirates from 1900 to 1917. The winner of eight batting titles and a member of the ﬁrst group of players inductedinto the Baseball Hall of Fame, Wagner led the Pirates to three straight pennants at the turn of the 20th centuryand to an appearance in the ﬁrst World Series (1903), which Pittsburgh lost to the Boston Red Sox in eight games.The Pirates won their ﬁrst World Series title in 1909, but the team struggled in the 1910s before returning to theWorld Series to defeat the Washington Senators in 1925. They reached the World Series again in 1927 but lost to astandout New York Yankees squad that featured Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.Less-successful years followed, but the Pirates, led by future Hall ofFame member Roberto Clemente, won the 1960 World Seriesdramatically with Bill Mazeroski’s game-winning home run in theninth inning of the seventh game. In the 1970s the Pirates left ForbesField, their home for more than 60 years, to play in Three RiversStadium, where the power hitting of Willie Stargell and Dave Parkerhelped them clinch the NL Eastern Division six times and win WorldSeries championships in 1971 and 1979. In the mid-1980s the Piratesacquired sluggers Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla, and the teamﬁnished atop the NL Eastern Division in three consecutive seasons(1990–92) but failed to advance to the World Series each year.Bonds signed with the San Francisco Giants as a free agent after the 1992 season, and the Pirates (who beganplaying in PNC Park in 2001) soon became one of the worst teams in baseball. In 2009 the Pirates had their 17thstraight losing season, a record for a professional franchise in the four major North American sports leagues. Thatstreak extended to 20 consecutive seasons until it was broken in 2013, when the Bucs, led by NL Most ValuablePlayer Andrew McCutchen, won 94 games and earned a berth in the postseason, where the team won the one-game Wild Card playoff but was eliminated in the NL Division Series. Pittsburgh returned to the postseason thefollowing year but was eliminated in the Wild Card Game. In 2015 the team won 98 games—Pittsburgh’s bestseason since the Bonds era and the second most wins in the major leagues that year—but the team was relegated
to the Wild Card contest because of the Pirates residing in the same division as the 100-win St. Louis Cardinals,and the Bucs again lost the one-game playoff. The team’s three-season postseason streak ended in 2016 asPittsburgh posted a losing record. The Pirates continued to struggle in the ensuing years, and in 2021 the team lost101 games.Adam Augustyn",Pittsburgh Pirates,"Roberto Clemente was a Puerto Rican baseball player who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1968 to 1972. He won the 1960 World Series with the Pirates and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. The Pirates have a long history in baseball, including winning the World Series five times and reaching the World Series in 1903 and 1925. The team has struggled in recent years, with the Pirates finishing last in the National League East in 2021."

Dr. Farnam Jahanian President Henry L. Hillman President's Chair As CMU continues to work together to create a more diverse, inclusive, equitable and multiculturally aware community, we are guided by our vision of a framework for inclusive excellence. Together, we can use this framework to reflect our shared goals, promote transparency and accountability, and align our strategies and everyday action to our core DEIB values. Dr. Wanda Heading-Grant Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Diversity A broad concept that includes differences in societys opportunities, the shaping of social institutions by different social factors, the formation of group and individual identity, and the processes of social change. This includes race, class, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, disability, language, and region of residence, among others. Equity Equity occurs when all people or groups in a community are given access to the correct number and types of resources that enable them to achieve equal results. Equity differs from equality, which focuses on the equal distribution of resources, rather than on equal results. Inclusion The notion that an organization or system is welcoming to new populations and/or identities. Each new presence is not merely tolerated, but expected to contribute meaningfully to the system in a positive, mutually beneficial way. Inclusive processes and practices strive to bring groups together to make decisions in collaborative, mutual, and equitable ways. Belonging Mutual power, access, and opportunity among all groups and individuals within a shared community (such as a society, organization, club, etc). Operationalizing belonging requires that all groups and individuals can contribute to and impact the community to which they seek to belong. Their contributions and impact may entail a profound transformation of the community itself, beyond the mere inclusion of individuals within them.

"Rankings -     CMU - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University    Search Search CMU  About              Rankings Rankings College and university rankings continue to proliferate, but their value to individuals and to the institutions remains a subject of some debate. Some rankings are designed purely for entertainment, little more than internet photo galleries. Others make a more serious effort at collecting information. Even where rankings do collect objective statistics such as test scores or costs, the choice of which factors to include in a ranking, and how those factors are weighted, remains subjective. The effects of those methodologies, and the reasons for those choices, are not always readily apparent. For prospective students, families, potential staff and faculty who are deciding whether to invest time and resources in an institution, it is essential that you decide what factors are important to your success and the outcomes you seek. Those will include some objective information, which you can find on the pages of the Carnegie Mellon University website, or on sites for which CMU provides information, such as IPEDS College Navigator or collegedata.com . Your decision should also take into account your own assessment about programs, culture and opportunities for growth.

"History -     CMU - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University    Search Search CMU  About              History Andrew Carnegie A self-educated ""working boy"" who loved books, Andrew Carnegie emigrated from Scotland in 1848 and settled in Pittsburgh, Pa. Attending night school and borrowing books, Carnegie went from factory worker in a textile mill to successful entrepreneur and industrialist. He rose to prominence by founding what became the world's largest steel producing company by the end of the 19th century. Carnegie Technical Schools At one point the richest man in the world, Carnegie believed that ""to die rich is to die disgraced."" He turned his attention to writing, social activism and philanthropy, determined to establish educational opportunities for the general public where few existed. In 1900, he donated $1 million for the creation of a technical institute for the city of Pittsburgh, envisioning a school where working-class men and women of Pittsburgh could learn practical skills, trades and crafts that would enhance their careers, lives and communities. ""My heart is in the work,"" he stated, which would become part of the school's official motto. The Carnegie Technical Schools offered two- and three-year certificates in the arts as well as in engineering disciplines and included a college for women, Margaret Morrison Carnegie College. Carnegie Tech  Early Years Soon faced with the demand for baccalaureate programs, Carnegie Technical Schools began offering bachelor's degrees through its College of Engineering and College of Fine Arts, becoming the Carnegie Institute of Technology, or ""Carnegie Tech."" During the first half of the 20th century, with support from Andrew Carnegie and other funders, Carnegie Tech laid the foundation for a school on the cutting edge. Some key developments were: It expanded from two buildings into an elegant 20th century campus designed in the beaux arts architectural style, housing a wealth of machine shops, studios and laboratories  the hands-on center of learning that persists today. It pioneered conservatory degree programs in music and drama, in addition to visual art and design programs. The first U.S. drama degree was awarded in 1914 at Carnegie Tech. It began offering graduate degrees. In 1919, the first doctorate (in civil engineering) was awarded to Mao Yisheng, a student from China. It laid the groundwork for a research institution, recruiting leading scientists, offering sponsored fellowships with government and industry leaders and pioneering nontraditional interdisciplinary research, which brought together physicists, chemists and metallurgists, for example. Interdisciplinary research would become the hallmark of Carnegie Mellon research. It initiated the 'Carnegie Plan' in 1938, a new curriculum that required science and engineer students to take courses in humanities and social sciences in order to better understand the needs of society. Carnegie died in 1919, but his vision for an educated public lived on after him. Carnegie Tech - Post-war Years With the end of World War II, the latter half of the 20th century brought unprecedented growth to Carnegie Tech. In 1956, the arrival of the first IBM computer to campus was revolutionary, initiating a university culture where information technology pervaded virtually all areas of study. University culture also changed in 1973 when Margaret Morrison closed and women joined their male peers in classrooms and dorms. The times were changing, and Tech positioned itself at the forefront, opening three new schools: 1948: The Graduate School of Industrial Administration, later renamed the David A. Tepper School of Business , focusing on quantitative analysis and pioneering the field of management science. 1968: School of Urban and Public Affairs, later renamed the H. John Heinz III College , providing graduate training for work in the public sector. 1986: School of Computer Science , pioneering computing and artificial intelligence, led by interdisciplinary efforts of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon. Carnegie Mellon University In 1967, Carnegie Tech merged with the Mellon Institute, a science research center founded by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, to become known as Carnegie Mellon University. The merger built upon a long history of support from the Mellons. It allowed Carnegie Mellon to establish the last of its current pillars: the Mellon College of Science and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, now known as Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences . In 2017, Carnegie Mellon celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger, revisiting the shared vision of the founders and recognizing the impact it has had, and will continue to have, in the world of higher education, research and discovery. A Global Impact In its 115 years, Carnegie Mellon has soared to national and international leadership in higher education and research. A birthplace of innovation since its founding, it continues to be known for innovation, for solving real-world problems and for interdisciplinary collaboration. Its alumni can be found across the globe  from Tony Award winners to Nobel Prize and Turing Award winners, from CEOs to entrepreneurs, from professors to artists. In the 2000s, in response to demand for expanded international educational opportunities, Carnegie Mellon began offering degree programs outside of Pittsburgh. Today its global presence includes campuses in Qatar and Silicon Valley, Calif., more than a dozen degree-granting locations and more than 20 research partnerships such as Los Angeles; New York City; Washington, D.C.; Australia; China; Portugal and Rwanda. The Future CMU is positioned like never before to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In the coming years, the university will see the largest expansion to the Pittsburgh campus since 1900. At the intersection of technology and humanity, CMU research, innovation and creativity will continue to guide our future as a world-class university. As outlined in the Strategic Plan 2025 , the university will focus on advancing the individual student experience, the broader Carnegie Mellon community experience, and the social impact of Carnegie Mellon throughout the world.

"Traditions -     CMU - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University    Search Search CMU  About              Traditions Traditions Dating back more than a century, some Carnegie Mellon University traditions have a Scottish flavor (The Kiltie Band) as a nod to founder Andrew Carnegie. Other experiences blossomed from the minds of students (The Fence). Kiltie Band This kilt-clad student marching band  the self-named "" Band Without Pants ""  has entertained home football games with songs, chants, cheers and a quirky sense of humor since 1922. The Fence The Fence is painted between midnight and sunrise by students who then stand guard as long as they want their message to stay. Fun Fact: The original Fence was once the ""most painted object in the world"" until it collapsed and was replaced by a steel-concrete fence. Spring Carnival The entire community comes together for this four-day festival, Carnegie Mellon's oldest tradition. Buggy Sweepstakes A Spring Carnival highlight, students race "" buggies ,"" often reaching up to 35 mph. Student groups design and build the aerodynamic cylinders  ""pushmobiles,"" as they were called when the tradition started in 1920. Bagpipers It doesn't get more Scottish than bagpipes. Carnegie Mellon's Pipes and Drums can be found practicing around campus and performing at formal university events. Autographs Behind the stage of Kresge Theatre senior ""dramats"" ( drama students) sign the walls and ceiling before graduating.

Succeeding on this front requires us to both expand access and remove barriers to opportunity in pursuit of a more inclusive and diverse learning environment. These efforts are ongoing and remain critical to our university's mission to advance learning, research, and creativity and make a positive impact on society more broadly."" Dr. Farnam Jahanian President Henry L. Hillman President's Chair As CMU continues to work together to create a more diverse, inclusive, equitable and multiculturally aware community, we are guided by our vision of a framework for inclusive excellence. Together, we can use this framework to reflect our shared goals, promote transparency and accountability, and align our strategies and everyday action to our core DEIB values. Dr. Wanda Heading-Grant Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Diversity A broad concept that includes differences in societys opportunities, the shaping of social institutions by different social factors, the formation of group and individual identity, and the processes of social change. This includes race, class, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, disability, language, and region of residence, among others. Equity Equity occurs when all people or groups in a community are given access to the correct number and types of resources that enable them to achieve equal results. Equity differs from equality, which focuses on the equal distribution of resources, rather than on equal results. Inclusion The notion that an organization or system is welcoming to new populations and/or identities. Each new presence is not merely tolerated, but expected to contribute meaningfully to the system in a positive, mutually beneficial way. Inclusive processes and practices strive to bring groups together to make decisions in collaborative, mutual, and equitable ways. Belonging Mutual power, access, and opportunity among all groups and individuals within a shared community (such as a society, organization, club, etc). Operationalizing belonging requires that all groups and individuals can contribute to and impact the community to which they seek to belong. Their contributions and impact may entail a profound transformation of the community itself, beyond the mere inclusion of individuals within them.

Hopfield of Princeton University and Geoffrey E. Hinton of the University of Toronto in recognition of their foundational work in machine learning with artificial neural networks. Inspired by the human brain, artificial neural networks are computing systems used to process data and learn from it. Hinton served on the Computer Science Department faculty at Carnegie Mellon University from 1982-87. He received Carnegie Mellon's 2021 Dickson Prize in Science (opens in new window) . ""The Nobel Prize is one of the most significant and cherished public recognitions of researchers today,"" said CMU President Farnam Jahanian (opens in new window) . ""Our extended Carnegie Mellon University community is extraordinarily proud to see Geoffrey Hinton's talents and pioneering research celebrated in such a meaningful way and grateful for his many scholarly contributions to computer science, AI and society."" At CMU, he co-authored an influential paper on the backpropagation algorithm, which allows neural networks to discover their own internal representations of data. He demonstrated that the algorithm enabled neural networks to solve problems previously thought to be beyond their reach. The prize announcement also cites work Hinton did on Boltzmann machines with Terrence Sejnowksi, then at Johns Hopkins University. Later, at the University of Toronto, Hinton and his students made improvements to convolutional neural networks that cut error rates for object recognition in half, reshaping the field of computer vision. The laureates work has already been of the greatest benefit. In physics we use artificial neural networks in a vast range of areas, such as developing new materials with specific properties, said Ellen Moons, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics. At the University of Toronto, Hinton advised Ruslan Salakhutdinov (opens in new window) as he pursued his Ph.D. from 2005-09. Now the UPMC Professor of Computer Science in CMUs Machine Learning Department (MLD), Salakhutdinov cited Hinton as his key influence. I wouldnt be where I am today without Geoff and his guidance, Salakhutdinov said. Geoff basically discovered this unique algorithm that could train these deep networks efficiently. This laid the groundwork for a lot of the deep learning models and architecture, and it inspired a lot of people to start looking into it  it was all driven by Geoff. Salakhutdinov continues to work on generative models at Carnegie Mellon, including large language models, AI agents, deep learning and decision making. He said that Hinton thought fondly of CMU. When he was at CMU, it was amazing. He would go to CMU and see all of these students and researchers in the labs working hard and believe that they were creating the future, and that unique environment was something that he loved, Salakhutdinov said. As the director of MLD at CMU, Zico Kolter is guiding the School of Computer Science through the research revolution brought on by generative artificial intelligence tools. His own research revolves around machine learning, optimization and control, with much of the work centered on making deep learning algorithms safer, more robust and more modular. Kolter previously demonstrated how its possible to circumvent the safeguards of large language models . The field Geoff helped spawn  deep learning  has become one of the biggest things in our society, Kolter said. Almost all modern AI systems are based on deep learning. Geoff was foundational to deep learning. Born in 1947 in London, Hinton received his Ph.D. in 1978 from The University of Edinburgh. As an ACM Turing Award winner (along with Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun for their revolutionary work on deep neural networks), Hinton is the second person ever to earn both a Turing Award and a Nobel Prize  the first being another Carnegie Mellon professor, Herb Simon (opens in new window) . The Nobel Prize comes with an award of 11 million Swedish Kronor, or $1 million, split between the winners.

The students  Claire Jin, Yunshu Li and Katherine Parry  were selected from a pool of more than 5,000 applicants for the federally endowed award, which provides coverage fees, books, room and board, and tuition up to $7,500. The award from the Barry Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation (opens in new window) is specifically awarded to sophomores or juniors who display academic rigor and a strong commitment to pursuing education in the natural sciences, engineering or mathematics. With the latest awardees, Carnegie Mellon has had a total of 51 students receive the scholarship since its inception. We are immensely proud of these three students, said CMU President Farnam Jahanian (opens in new window) . It is wonderful to see Carnegie Mellon Universitys roster of Goldwater Scholars grow and even more exciting to see our students recognized for their talents and hard work on the national stage. Congratulations to the winners from CMU  and to all the students who earned this distinction. Richelle Bernazzoli, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research and Scholar Development (opens in new window) (OURSD), celebrated the students continued success and commitment to scientific achievement and academic excellence. Claire, Yunshu and Katherine have already achieved so much in their fields, and the really exciting thing is that they are just getting started, Bernazzoli said. We greatly enjoyed getting to know them throughout the nomination process and we have been so impressed by the clarity of their goals and their dedication to their research areas. We cant wait to see where their continued education and scholarship take them. Claire Jin Claire Jin Claire Jin wants to improve how generative artificial intelligence is incorporated into robotics. More specifically, she wants to help create adaptable, reliable and transparent robotic systems that integrate with generative AI. By incorporating physical intuition, situational awareness, and the ability to infer human intentions, Jin wants to improve how people interact with robots. Additionally, by improving model generalizability to a variety of tasks and interpretability, she aims to help users troubleshoot more easily. The third-year student in the School of Computer Science (opens in new window) is working with the Connecting Language to Action and the World (CLAW) Lab (opens in new window) on how AI programs reason and converse when they collaborate with humans or other robots to perform tasks without a single solution. Knowing the caliber of previous scholars and their remarkable achievements in both industry and academia, I feel a sense of awe and gratitude, Jin said. It's an incredible honor to be recognized among such esteemed individuals, and I'm eager to contribute similarly with my future research. Jin, who will earn her bachelors degree in AI with an additional major in statistics in December, already has a great deal of experience working with large language models, and plans to pursue a Ph.D. Her previous work includes using large language models for text-based game development and bug detection with Microsoft Researchs Natural Language Processing Group (opens in new window) , refining multimodal models with its Knowledge and Language Team (opens in new window) , and optimizing queueing strategies through reinforcement learning. Jin began her research journey in high school, where she led a project under mentorship from Zita Oravecz (opens in new window) in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies (opens in new window) at Penn State University (opens in new window) on predicting stress onset in adolescents based on physiological signals collected using wearable devices. The work was later published in 2023 following reanalysis using deep learning methods Jin learned at CMU and presented at the IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Body Sensor Networks (opens in new window) with support from the Carnegie Mellon OURSD Presentation Award (opens in new window) . ""I am deeply grateful for the pivotal role CMU's School of Computer Science has played in shaping my journey. Our school has provided me with so many enriching opportunities, from engaging in challenging classes to collaborating on projects with esteemed professors, Jin said, noting the mentorship she received from academic and research advisers Reid Simmons (opens in new window) , Weina Wang (opens in new window) and Yonatan Bisk (opens in new window) , as well as professors Daniel Sleator (opens in new window) , Daniel Anderson (opens in new window) and David Woodruff (opens in new window) , to whom she has served as a teaching assistant. Their mentorship has not only fostered my academic growth but has also imparted valuable lessons that have shaped me into a more well-rounded individual, Jin said. Yunshu Li Yunshu Li Yunshu Li, a third-year physics student in the Mellon College of Science (opens in new window) , is a Pittsburgh native whose academic research has spanned multiple fields at both Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh. Li received the Robert W. Kraemer Award (opens in new window) for her work as a first-year student. Her first research experience at CMU was in Stephanie Tristram-Nagles (opens in new window) experimental biophysics lab, where she studied novel antibiotic treatments for multidrug-resistant bacteria. She continued to make progress in the study of novel antimicrobials in the laboratory of Dr. Berthony Deslouches (opens in new window) at Pitt. One major takeaway Ive had from all of the labs Ive worked in is that theyve taught me how to ask meaningful questions, design productive experiments to explore these questions, and disseminate information effectively to diverse audiences. I am incredibly grateful for all of the mentors that Ive met during my time as an undergrad here at CMU. Working under the guidance of mentors who are both enthusiastic about research and leaders in their fields has greatly shaped my own passion for research, Li added. Currently, Li is conducting research into the effects of attention on different levels of the auditory processing pathway in the Lab in Multisensory Neuroscience (opens in new window) at CMU under the guidance of Barbara Shinn-Cunningham (opens in new window) , Abigail Noyce (opens in new window) and Ph.D. candidate Victoria Figarola (opens in new window) . An area of focus in the lab is on how our brains allow us to focus attention and suppress uninteresting sound in complex auditory environments, and what particularly excites me is the potential to leverage the insights we can gain from auditory neuroscience studies to aid individuals with hearing pathologies, Li said. What Ive enjoyed the most about working in this lab is being able to use both behavioral and computational methods in combination with noninvasive neuroimaging techniques to assess brain function in human subjects. For Li, much of what motivates her inside of the lab also takes place outside of it. As an undergraduate teaching assistant in introductory physics courses for both majors and nonmajors, she was able to explore her passion for helping others learn the sciences in the lecture hall setting. Ive really enjoyed my time as a teaching assistant, Li said. I think its taught me how to think about problems from different perspectives, and how to work on my communications skills so that I can most effectively engage with a broad range of students. Additionally, volunteering at UPMC Shadyside has influenced her research interests and bolstered her professional goals. In this volunteer position, Li works with elderly patients to help prevent hospital-acquired delirium. Working directly with patients has been a formative experience for me which has solidified my commitment to pursuing a career that can integrate research with health care. All of this work, both in and outside the lab, has inspired Li to pursue a combined MD/Ph.D. in neuroscience after her undergraduate studies. In the future, I see myself working as a physician-scientist who is seeing patients while also teaching and conducting research at an academic medical institution. Katherine Parry Katherine Parry Katherine Parry is a junior studying electrical and computer engineering (opens in new window) and physics. Katherine is amazing and beyond deserving of the Goldwater Scholarship, said Larry Pileggi (opens in new window) , the Coraluppi Head and Tanoto Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I was astonished by her passion and dedication to research. Her work is the caliber of that for a Ph.D. student, so I am excited to see the outcomes. It is exciting to be recognized for my many years of intensive research, said Parry. I am glad to contribute to the prominence and recognition that Carnegie Mellon University and the College of Engineering deserve. Parrys research focuses on designing faster computers through alternative approaches to computation. DNA sequencing, which results in new cures, and machine learning have only become feasible with faster computation, explained Parry. Interesting changes are being experienced as transistors are measured in 20-atom widths, and wire accounts for more delay than transistor gates. We're coming to the end of smaller circuitry. What will we do then? That is the answer I'm chasing. Parry is not a stranger to research. At the age of 16, she was working on a Mandelbrot generator for a science fair project. While focusing on increasing the processing speed, she discovered instances that had yet to be addressed. Mandelbrots are very square intensive, and I wanted to speed it up, Parry explained. I did some Googling and came across a couple of papers by T.C. Chen and R.H. Strandberg on how they cut the square computation in half by using Boolean logic to combine terms. However, I noticed some commonalities in the remaining elements that they hadn't addressed. I started playing around with the logic, and the elements got ugly and complicated. Tenacity is an important characteristic of a researcher. I persisted, and suddenly, I was looking at something incredibly beautiful. Those ugly computations suddenly simplified. The optimization of squares is measured in the number of additions required. The previous 16-bit squarer requires 35 adds; mine takes 29. As a homeschooled student in South Dakota, there were limited opportunities for Parry to discuss her findings with others. Turning to the internet, she came across a call for papers for the IEEE Symposium on Computational Arithmetic (opens in new window) (ARITH). I quickly did my best to write a research paper that was due soon. They would know if I had done something original. Their response was an invitation to speak to the world's leading computer researchers at their symposium in Kyoto, Japan. Because of that talk, I became part of their community, and even though they are all across the world, we correspond often. The talk also resulted in my first published paper. When it came time to apply to colleges, Carnegie Mellon was the clear choice in her mind. Not only does Carnegie Mellon have the most professors teaching computer design, but we have all the tools, and unheard of, we can tape-out computer chips, explained Parry. I have had several very famous researchers from the ARITH community envious of my CMU resources and ask to co-author papers so I can provide more credibility to their ideas. It wasn't by chance; I made a very informed decision in choosing CMU. As for her career goal, that is an easy decision, too. I want nothing more than to be a research professor at CMU, says Parry. I love doing research, and Carnegie Mellon University is a great place to do it.

You really cant get away from it, said Sean Burke, vice president of a healthcare startup who is pursuing a masters degree in public management (opens in new window) at Carnegie Mellon University. Even if I try to stay off of political subreddits, I cant watch a video on Youtube without seeing ads for both candidates. You truly have to be in the woods offline if you want to avoid it. It can be challenging to break away from the screens, in part because social media is designed to keep users engaged and online. Ari Lightman (opens in new window) , a distinguished service professor of digital media and marketing in Carnegie Mellons Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy (opens in new window) , explained,  The algorithms on social media platforms work in a similar fashion to how marketers use recommendation engines.These systems can help predict what content online users will likely engage with or consume. In addition, through ingesting vast amounts of usage data and associating it with online personas, algorithms can predict your interests and community associations with your behavior patterns. This is especially true when there is a high degree of relevance between messaging and an online user's ideology. There is no escaping it. It is happening continuously and constantly . Can legislation help ease election anxieties? Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., together with Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., recently introduced legislation to create mental health warning label requirements for social media platforms. The bipartisan Stop the Scroll Act (opens in new window) would ensure users are aware of the potential mental health risks associated with social media use. The average person spends 2.5 hours a day on social media. According to this years American Psychiatric Associations annual mental health poll (opens in new window) , adults in the U.S. are feeling increasingly anxious, with 73% of those surveyed saying they feel particularly anxious about the election. People are getting fed up with the political discussions online, but there is still a heavy population thats using social media to promote their messaging and appeal to their base, so were constantly exposed to it, Lightman said. Were constantly inundated. How are CMU professors addressing anxiety? J. David Creswell (opens in new window) , the William S. Dietrich II Professor in Psychology and Neuroscience at CMU, said if people care about the outcome of an upcoming election, it can be easy to get stuck in patterns of anxiety and stress. Election season is kind of like riding in a plane. We dont have much control over what happens, and for some people that can be overwhelming, Creswell said. One approach can be  to wrestle back a sense of control during election season  is to think about ways you do have control, such as how you can vote and make a difference. Researchers call this coping strategy cognitive reappraisal. Its basically thinking differently in ways that lessen our negative emotions. Creswell has dedicated much of his research to understanding how mindfulness and equanimity can enhance resilience and performance. L everaging over 15 years of research from his Health and Human Performance Lab (opens in new window) at CMU, Creswell co-founded Equa (opens in new window) , a mindfulness training app designed to help users manage stress and improve their overall wellbeing. CMU students, faculty and staff can download the Equa app (opens in new window) and use their @andrew.cmu.edu email address to unlock a complimentary subscription, thanks to the universitys partnership with Equa Health. What strategies are students using to cope with election anxiety? Sofia Reyes Franco considers herself somewhat anxious about the election. As a senior studying information systems at Carnegie Mellon, she is familiar with how algorithms work. Shes actually in the process of developing an app that would use algorithms to help develop personal styling choices. Franco has plenty of friends who discuss politics online and in person, but she prefers to keep her political views to herself. Im trying to stay out of it for the most part, she said. My voice will be heard when I cast my vote. Francos strategy for keeping calm between now and Nov. 5 includes staying off social media and keeping busy with school work and other interests. Im on the Club Swimming (opens in new window) team, so Ill go to practice. Club swimming is a fun way to keep in shape and be part of a great group of people on campus. We have practices three times per week and have various social events, Franco said. But mostly, Ill just focus on my homework. I also read a lot. Ill read just to kind of get myself out of this space and be transported into a different reality. Burke has a golden retriever that loves to go on walks, so getting outdoors will be his number one strategy for managing stress between now and election day. He and his wife also enjoy going to the gym. The analytical approach to social media and elections As students in Lightmans Measuring Social (opens in new window) class this semester, Burke and Franco are gaining tools and knowledge for analyzing social media to benefit global brands, and they are getting to apply it all in real time. Good timing or bad timing, its super interesting to be taking this course during the presidential campaign. Well learn and discuss something in class, and then Ill look at my phone and its all right there. So, theres that epiphany moment of oh, right, that makes sense. he said. Given thevigorous and sometimes heated debates online,Burke particularly appreciates Lightmans analytical approach. It really helps you to take a step back and put a different lens on how you view these things, to look at whats happening online more objectively rather than get caught up in it, Burke said. So what can you do to help ease election anxiety? Three quick tips Practice cognitive reappraisal (opens in new window) . Stay active.

Managing Election Anxiety May Mean Less Time on Social Media - Carnegie Mellon University

Managing election anxiety may mean less time on social media. Experts say that the constant stream of campaign ads and political news can be overwhelming. To break away from the screens, try staying offline and engaging in activities that promote mental well-being, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones. By focusing on what you can control, such as how you vote, you can take back a sense of control during election season.

Here are some tips to help you manage election anxiety:

1.  **Practice cognitive reappraisal**: This involves thinking differently about the situation and finding ways to manage your emotions. You can try to focus on what you can control, such as how you vote, and take a step back to look at the situation more objectively.
2.  **Stay active**: Engage in physical activity, such as exercise or sports, to help reduce stress and anxiety.
3.  **Calm your mind**: Use meditation or other relaxation techniques to help manage your emotions.
4.  **Focus on what you can control**: Instead of getting caught up in the constant stream of information, try to focus on what you can control, such as how you vote.

This commitment drives our pursuit of creating a space where every voice can be heard. We seek to cultivate diverse populations and perspectives and promote equity and inclusion. Our devotion to these ideals springs from a core belief in the power of education to be a transformative and enriching force for every person, irrespective of their background, identity or life circumstances. Inclusion and belonging are intricately interwoven into the very essence of our university, helping to shape our values, policies and practices. Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging are not only central to our ethos but also indispensable to our pursuit of academic excellence and innovation. Let's continue on this journey together.

Succeeding on this front requires us to both expand access and remove barriers to opportunity in pursuit of a more inclusive and diverse learning environment.

Dr. Farnam Jahanian President Henry L. Hillman President's Chair As CMU continues to work together to create a more diverse, inclusive, equitable and multiculturally aware community, we are guided by our vision of a framework for inclusive excellence. Together, we can use this framework to reflect our shared goals, promote transparency and accountability, and align our strategies and everyday action to our core DEIB values. Dr. Wanda Heading-Grant Vice Provost for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Diversity A broad concept that includes differences in societys opportunities, the shaping of social institutions by different social factors, the formation of group and individual identity, and the processes of social change. This includes race, class, age, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, religion, disability, language, and region of residence, among others. Equity Equity occurs when all people or groups in a community are given access to the correct number and types of resources that enable them to achieve equal results. Equity differs from equality, which focuses on the equal distribution of resources, rather than on equal results. Inclusion The notion that an organization or system is welcoming to new populations and/or identities. Each new presence is not merely tolerated, but expected to contribute meaningfully to the system in a positive, mutually beneficial way. Inclusive processes and practices strive to bring groups together to make decisions in collaborative, mutual, and equitable ways. Belonging Mutual power, access, and opportunity among all groups and individuals within a shared community (such as a society, organization, club, etc). Operationalizing belonging requires that all groups and individuals can contribute to and impact the community to which they seek to belong. Their contributions and impact may entail a profound transformation of the community itself, beyond the mere inclusion of individuals within them.

During his tenure, Suresh initiated the year-long, campus-wide effort that resulted in the universitys Strategic Plan 2025, and oversaw an historic expansion of the universitys facilities, highlighted by the creation of the David A. Tepper Quadrangle. Among his signature accomplishments were the creation of the Presidential Fellowships and Scholarships program, implementation of the strategic plan, assembling the most diverse leadership team in university history, launching an initiative to enhance the CMU Experience, forging new partnerships with global interests such as Tata Consulting Services , and hosting President Barack Obamas White House Frontiers Conference . Suresh also led the establishment of several major programs and initiatives at Carnegie Mellon, including: the Simon Initiative to enhance the impact of technology-enhanced learning within the university and around the globe; BrainHub , to further CMUs interdisciplinary strengths to advance brain research; and the Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship A distinguished engineer and scientist, Suresh was the first and only university president to be elected to three major National Academies  the National Academy of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. He is also an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors. Prior to his tenure at Carnegie Mellon, Suresh served as director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), and dean of the School of Engineering and the Vannevar Bush Professor of Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Suresh received his bachelor of technology degree from the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras; a masters degree from Iowa State University; and completed a doctor of science degree from MIT. Following postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, he joined the faculty of engineering at Brown University in 1983, and was promoted to full professor in 1989. He joined MIT in 1993 as the R.P. Simmons Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and served as head of MITs Department of Materials Science and Engineering from 2000-2006. View Dr. Suresh's video archive Jared L. Cohon, 1997 - 2013 After becoming president of Carnegie Mellon University in 1997, Jared L. Cohon guided all of the university's global expansion efforts, and successfully led the university on a variety of fronts, including diversity, technology, international education, and economic development in southwest Pennsylvania. Ranked 22nd in the world by the London Times Higher Education supplement in 2013, Carnegie Mellon became one of the largest and fastest-growing universities in terms of global expansion. Through Cohon's leadership, the university grew from having few international programs to offering 16 degree programs in 14 countries. Before joining Carnegie Mellon, Cohon served as dean of the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies at Yale University from 1992 to 1997. He started his teaching and research career in 1973 at Johns Hopkins University, where he was a faculty member in the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering for 19 years. He also served as assistant and associate dean of Engineering and vice provost for research at Johns Hopkins. Cohon earned a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 1969 and a PhD in civil engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1973. An author, coauthor, or editor of one book and more than 80 professional publications, Cohon is an expert on environmental and water resource systems analysis, an interdisciplinary field that combines engineering, economics, and applied mathematics. He has worked on water resource problems in the United States, South America, and Asia and on energy facility siting, including nuclear waste shipping and storage. In addition to his academic experience, he served in 1977 and 1978 as a legislative assistant for energy and the environment to the late Honorable Daniel Patrick Moynihan, United States senator from New York. President Bill Clinton appointed Cohon to the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board in 1995 and appointed him as chairman in 1997. In 2002, President George W. Bush appointed Cohon to the Homeland Security Advisory Council , and in 2009 he was reappointed by President Barack Obama. In 2014, Cohon was appointed co-chair of the Congressionally mandated Commission to Review and Evaluate the National Energy Laboratories. He has also chaired several committees of the National Academies of Science and Engineering, most recently leading the committee that produced the report, ""The Hidden Costs of Energy,"" and a committeethat evaluated vehicle technologies to meet national fuel economy standards. In 2012, Cohon received the National Engineering Award from the American Association of Engineering Societies. He was elected to membership in the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, also in 2012. He has received honorary degrees from Carnegie Mellon University, the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the University of Pittsburgh. Cohon currently serves as director of the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation and as University Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Department of Engineering and Public Policy. He also serves on the boards of several companies and nonprofit organizations. Robert Mehrabian, 1990 - 1997 Under Robert Mehrabian, former dean of the College of Engineering at the University of California at Santa Barbara, Carnegie Mellon continued to climb among the nation's elite universities, making great strides in improving undergraduate education and the quality of life on campus for students, faculty and staff. Enhancements in academic programs and student activities were initiated that helped student applications soar to more than 13,000 in 1996, more than doubling the amount in Mehrabian's inaugural year in office. Mentoring and advising initiatives and efforts to enhance undergraduate teaching helped to attract high-quality students and greatly improved the student retention rate. A key to realizing these major improvements was Mehrabian's implementation of external advisory boards that reviewed and critiqued every academic and administrative unit. Mehrabian oversaw the completion of the East Campus Project, an ambitious building plan for the eastern part of campus that resulted in a new $47 million University Center, two new residence halls, Gesling Stadium  a facility for intercollegiate and intramural athletics  and a new multi-level indoor parking garage. Construction during Mehrabian's tenure also included a new home for the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute at the Pittsburgh Technology Center; Posner Hall, a facility that doubled the size of the graduate business school; George A. Roberts Engineering Hall; the Intelligent Workplace, a research area for the School of Architecture; and the Purnell Center for the Arts, a new home for the School of Drama. During the Mehrabian administration, Carnegie Mellon played a vital role in the Regional Economic Revitalization Initiative, which developed a plan for economic development in the greater Pittsburgh area. Mehrabian stimulated the university's technology transfer operation and led the development of the Pittsburgh Technology Center, helping to lure the Union Switch & Signal Corporation to move its regional headquarters for research there. Richard M. Cyert, 1972 - 1990 Richard M. Cyert, known to many as the patriarch of Carnegie Mellon University, led the school to national prominence by implementing a strategy to pursue areas in which the university had the talent and expertise to make the most impact. Cyert realized that the university could not be everything to everyone, but in certain areas could be the best in the world. In his inaugural address, Cyert stressed that his major goals were to balance the university's budget, improve education and research efforts, and establish a national reputation. He succeeded on all fronts. His sponsorship of computing initiatives and willingness to take risks played an important part in the development of the computing-intensive environment that exists today. The Robotics Institute, the largest academic research center of its kind, was established in 1979, and the School of Computer Science was founded in 1988. In partnership with IBM, the Andrew computing network was completed, making Carnegie Mellon the first university to design, implement and use a local-area-network system of computing linking personal computers at all faculty and student work stations to powerful central computer resources. Cyert also led a successful initiative to expand the school's recruiting base to attract top-notch students and faculty from around the world. By 1990, when Cyert retired to return to his position as professor in the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now the Tepper School of Business), Carnegie Mellon had made the transition from an excellent regional school to a prominent national research university with students and faculty bringing diverse backgrounds and perspectives from all parts of the globe. H. Guyford Stever, 1965 - 1972 One year after his inauguration, H. Guyford Stever announced that negotiations for a merger with the nearby Mellon Institute of Research had been finalized. The new entity was originally called Carnegie University, but very shortly the Mellon family agreed to add their name to the new institution, and thus Carnegie Mellon University was born. During Stever's administration, new colleges and schools were formed. The College of Humanities and Social Sciences (now Dietrich College), the Mellon College of Science, the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now College of Engineering), and the School of Urban and Public Affairs took their place beside the College of Fine Arts and the flourishing Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now the Tepper School of Business). One school, however, the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College for Women, ceased operations. Carnegie Mellon also made dramatic advances in computing. These advancements led the way for today's School of Computer Science, the Robotics Institute, the Software Engineering Institute, and the nation's first university-wide computing network, known as Andrew. In November 1971, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon nominated Stever to become director of the National Science Foundation, and Stever resigned in February 1972. John Christian Warner, 1950 - 1965 John Warner joined Carnegie Tech as an instructor in 1926 and rose through the ranks to professor, head of the Department of Chemistry, dean of graduate studies, university vice president, and finally president in 1950. Warner, a distinguished researcher, authored more than 80 published works on scientific and technical subjects and education in colleges and secondary schools. During World War II, he headed government research on the purification and metallurgy of plutonium for the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb. Recognizing that the university would only make progress with a distinguished faculty, Warner improved faculty salaries and fringe benefits. The graduate business school, named the Graduate School of Industrial Administration, was founded in 1949 and its building completed in 1952. The first computer on campus  an IBM 650 digital type machine  was housed in the basement of the business school. In the early 1960s, Hunt Library, including the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, opened, and the Scaife Hall of Engineering was completed. Warner acquired funding to support the development of Tech's Computation Center, the origin of Carnegie Mellon's world leadership in computing. The Computation Center was a joint project of the graduate business school and the departments of Psychology, Electrical Engineering and Mathematics. Robert E. Doherty, 1936 - 1950 Robert Doherty became president in March 1936 in the midst of the Great Depression. He brought with him superb preparation for leadership, a clear vision of what technical education ought to be, a firm commitment to promote graduate education and research, and strong administrative ability. In the mid-1940s, Doherty implemented an approach to undergraduate education called the ""Carnegie Plan."" The Carnegie Plan provided a well-rounded ""liberal/professional"" education in which students were taught to apply fundamental knowledge to solve practical problems and were required to learn about and appreciate academic disciplines outside their primary area of study. The Carnegie Plan, which received much national attention, was the forerunner to today's focus on an interdisciplinary, problem-solving university curriculum. When Doherty retired in June 1950, he left behind a student body in which full-time undergraduate and graduate students outnumbered part-time night students, a revitalized faculty whose members focused their energies on both teaching and research, a dramatic new curriculum, a reorganized administrative structure, an endowment that nearly doubled during his tenure, and an institution that would very quickly become one of the nation's premier universities. Most of the seeds for today's university were sown during the Doherty administration. Thomas S. Baker, 1922 - 1935 While constant change took place during the administration of his predecessor, Thomas Baker slowed the pace, giving Carnegie Tech a chance to breath. Few new academic developments took place during Baker's administration, but he did lead work to improve the physical appearance of the campus. Lawns were seeded, trees planted, and the muddy paths between buildings were replaced with concrete sidewalks. In addition to his work at the school, Baker became an ambassador for Carnegie Tech, spending many evenings singing the school's praises to audiences throughout Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, Baker suffered from poor health during his years as president and took several extended leaves to recuperate. In 1934, his health worsened, and he resigned a year later. Arthur A. Hamerschlag, 1903 - 1922 Trustees of the Carnegie Technical Schools elected Arthur Anton Hamerschlag, a well-known figure in industrial education in New York, as its first director in November 1903. In 1912, his title was changed to president. In the early 1900s, the institution was a trade school where young working people could learn the skills they needed to advance their careers. Trustees implemented a program for students who desired more specialized training in the sciences and the arts but lacked the resources to attend a four-year college. But by 1910, students found that their three-year degrees failed to qualify them for the jobs they sought, and it became clear that the school had to change to succeed. Hamerschlag led the development of four- and five-year programs that led to bachelor's and master's degrees, and in 1912, the Carnegie Technical Schools became the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now College of Engineering). Under Hamerschlag, the campus began to grow as four new buildings were constructed  Industries Hall (now Porter Hall), Engineering Hall (now Doherty Hall), Hamerschlag Hall and the College of Fine Arts Building. Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, a women's college named for school founder Andrew Carnegie's mother, was also established.

"Provost Priorities -     Leadership - Carnegie Mellon University Carnegie Mellon University    Search Search Search this site only Leadership Leadership  The Provost              Provost Priorities Provost Priorities The university's strategic plan is the foundation for the provost's priorities, which were derived, reinforced and prioritized through ongoing listening sessions with the Carnegie Mellon community. These seven areas of focus aim to strengthen the pillars of our institution.From student success and experience to diversity, equity and inclusion, our goal is to create a more holistically supportive and welcoming environment for the campus community. AY23-24 Provost Division Year in Review Heres a look at some of the great work being done across the division to further these priorities across the CMU community. Take a Look Access and Affordability In order to increase the socioeconomic diversity of Carnegie Mellon, we must endeavor to make Carnegie Mellon more accessible and affordable. As such, our goal is to continue efforts to meet the full financial needs of our student body. We will make undergraduate student aid and graduate fellowships a primary focus in the capital campaign. And, through our partnership with the Graduate Student Assembly, we will continue to explore ways to help our graduate students afford to attend CMU, such as providing partial support for healthcare, legal services, and conference funding. Tartan Scholars End of Year Celebration, 2022 Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Being a diverse, equitable and inclusive community is critical to our excellence as an educational, research and entrepreneurial university. The provost has charged the academic units with the task of creating a five-year university-wide strategic plan for diversity, equity and inclusion . In tandem, the administrative units of the university have been tasked with the same charge. Together our goal is to center our values for diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging in our institution's mission, language and climate. CMU Celebrates Pride Month, 2022 Student Success and Experience We strive to cultivate an environment that fosters student success and a high quality and supportive experience that provides opportunities for our students to grow and reflect as learners, communicators and scholars while on our campuses and beyond. All students should find success in their academic studies, graduate in a timely fashion and embark on a career pathway. In addition to academic development and enrichment programs, we also will seek to provide professional development resources for faculty and staff to excel as academic advisors and mentors. Tartan Football Team at Family Weekend, 2021 Realizing CMU Education 2025 The universitys Strategic Plan 2025 sets a vision for the type of education we seek to deliver to meet the needs of our students of the future. This vision builds upon the educational strengths of CMU that were outlined in the Carnegie Plan when the university was founded. To realize this vision, we are conducting and assessing a variety of pilots along five major dimensions: innovative curriculum, new pedagogy and technology enhanced learning, new competency-based modules, student success, new forms of interaction with external organizations and leadership education. Commencement Ceremony, 2022 Faculty Experience and Success Faculty experience and success requires adequate professional and leadership development, increased opportunities for underrepresented faculty, and access to resources for an enriching university experience. From new faculty orientation to development workshops, our priority is to provide each faculty member with the instruments they need for a fulfilling and rewarding career. Yisong Alex Guo, Associate Professor of Chemistry, 2019 Global Education Strategy Developing a global education strategy for Carnegie Mellon must explore what new international partnerships we should seek, new international educational programs we might offer, and review the existing campuses and degree programs outside of the United States. We must also examine how we can best leverage the tremendous international diversity we have across our programs, locations and campuses. Our distinctive approach to education must be evident in every program we offer, no matter where we are in the world. CMU-Africa Students, 2022 Sustainability,Efficiency and Effectiveness Sustainability reaches far beyond making ""green decisions"" for our campus community. Our sustainability initiative is based on the global sustainable development goals which range from peace, justice and strong institutions to good health and well-being for our campus community.

Schwertz Distinguished Professor of Life Sciences, began serving as the interim provost ofCarnegie Mellon Universityon July 1, 2014. Prior to his appointment, Dr. Urban had been head of the Department of Biological Sciences in CMU's Mellon College of Science since 2010. Dr. Urban joined CMU as a faculty member in 2002 after four years as a research fellow at the Max-Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, Germany, under the supervision of Nobel Laureate Bert Sakmann. Urban received his bachelor's degree in neuroscience from the University of Pittsburgh, studied mathematics and philosophy as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and earned his doctorate in neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh. In 2005, he was selected by Scientific American as one of the 50 leaders in science and technology. 2000 - 2014: Mark Kamlet Dr. Mark S. Kamlet, provost emeritus, is a professor of economics and public policy, with joint appointments in Carnegie Mellon Universitys H. John Heinz III College and in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences (SDS) in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. He joined Carnegie Mellon as a faculty member in 1976. From 1990 to 1993, he served as SDS department head. From 1993 to 2000, he served as Heinz College dean. In 2000, Dr. Kamlet began serving as provost (chief academic officer) and executive vice president of the university. As chief academic officer, he oversaw the research and educational activities of the academic side of campus, including budgetary and space issues, as well as the appointment, reappointment, promotion and tenure processes for faculty. He also was actively engaged in the universitys technology commercialization activities, the growing internationalization of the universitys global footprint and the role of technology in education. Dr. Kamlet earned his bachelors degree in mathematics from Stanford University, and a masters degree in mathematical statistics and Ph.D. in economics from the University of California at Berkeley. 1991 - 2000: Paul Christiano Paul Christiano spent most of his academic and professional career at Carnegie Mellon. He earned all of his civil engineering degrees from the university; after a brief period elsewhere, he returned to campus as an associate professor. He became a full professor in 1981, then served as associate dean of the College of Engineering from 1982-86, head of the Civil Engineering Department from 1986-88, and dean of the college from 1989-91. President Mehrabian named him provost in 1991. Christiano worked to strengthen all academic and research units and helped lead an educational movement at the university that fostered the growth of cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary education and research on campus. He stimulated the creation of new research programs that involved the collaboration of faculty and researchers across multiple academic units, specifically among the arts, engineering and computer science. Of particular importance to Christiano was his work with the Small Undergraduate Research Grant program, which allowed young scholars and scientists to explore their own areas of interest and hone their skills as researchers. He was also an advocate of technology-enhanced learning, and as provost he helped to establish the Technology Enhanced Learning Lab (now the Office of Technology for Education) to assist faculty in their use of technology to improve the education process. Christiano was at the center of strategic investments in each of the university's academic units, and his work enabled Carnegie Mellon's reputation to soar to its highest level in history. Christiano helped to establish the Office of Technology Transfer (now the Innovation Transfer Center) and the positions of vice provost for education and research. During his tenure, he also served as acting dean of the College of Fine Arts (1992-93) and the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (1995-96), as well as acting vice president for development (1999-2000). 1983 - 1991: Angel Jordan Angel Jordan joined the Carnegie Mellon community in 1956 as an instructor and doctoral student in Electrical Engineering. In the next two decades, Jordan rose through the faculty ranks, eventually becoming the Whitaker Professor of Electrical Engineering in 1972 and dean of the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now College of Engineering) in 1979. While he was provost, Jordan took a leadership role in attracting the Software Engineering Institute to Carnegie Mellon and in helping to establish the School of Computer Science. Undergraduate enrollment continued to grow and graduate enrollment nearly doubled between 1968 and 1988. The university also saw a major increase in sponsored research, and advisory boards were created to ensure that departments were giving their students the best education possible. The university thrived while Jordan was provost, attracting the brightest faculty members from the best universities in the nation. Their research helped place Carnegie Mellon among the United States' most prominent research institutions. In July 2003, Jordan was appointed acting director and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI). (Reference: Carnegie Mellon: A Centennial History , Carnegie Mellon University Press, Pittsburgh.) 1983 - 1991: John P. Crecine President Cyert named Crecine senior vice president for academic affairs, which had equal rank with provost but with separate duties. He served alongside Provost Angel Jordan. In his role, Crecine was responsible for administrating academic and policy, planning and budgeting, and was a strong supporter of the expansion of computer usage throughout campus. Prior to his appointment to senior vice president, he served as dean of CMU's newly-formed College of Humanities and Social Sciences, from 1976 - 1983. Under his leadership, Crecine transformed the college by launching its general education curriculum, and the Philosophy and the Social and Decision Sciences departments. He also guided the English department's transition to its current three-concentration model, and supported the continuation of the Computer Science and Statistics departments, which were originally not housed under a specific college. Throughout his time as dean, Crecine led with a focus on interdisciplinary learning and delivering excellence in selected domains of comparative advantage, which are hallmarks of a CMU education. After Crecine left Carnegie Mellon, he became president of Georgia Institute of Technology, where he founded its College of Computing, replicating the novel structures and approaches that had taken hold at Carnegie Mellon. 1981 - 1983: Daniel B. Berg and Richard Van Horn President Cyert continued to have two provosts in the 1980s. Berg joined the university from Westinghouse and, prior to becoming provost, served as dean of the Mellon College of Science. As dean, Berg was instrumental in fostering support from the university's department heads for creating the Robotics Institute. He also helped recruit the institute's first faculty and students. After three years as provost, Berg left Carnegie Mellon to serve as provost at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he later became president. Van Horn originally came from the faculty of the business school and also served as vice president of business affairs. Van Horn was in good stead with the faculty and personally visited every department during his tenure to hear criticism and explain priorities. He also strove to make computing accessible for everyone. Together with professors Herbert Simon and Alan Newell, Van Horn convinced President Cyert that a campus network of personal computers could be a valuable tool for the university community. Van Horn and Cyert approached IBM with a proposal to become partners in the Carnegie Mellon's Andrew Computing Network, the first networking venture on a university campus. Today, Carnegie Mellon has one of the ""most wired"" and ""wireless"" computing networks in the world. After he left Carnegie Mellon, Van Horn went on to serve as president at both the University of Houston and the University of Oklahoma. While Berg and Van Horn served as provosts, the University Teaching Center and Information Technology Center were established. Carnegie Mellon also became a leader in computer technology. 1973 - 1980: Arnold Weber Weber served as provost for the College of Humanities and Social Sciences (now Dietrich College), the School of Urban and Public Affairs (now Heinz College) and the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now the Tepper School of Business). He was also dean of the business school but resigned from the position in 1977 to concentrate on the provost's role. He left Carnegie Mellon in 1980 to become president at Northwestern University. 1964 - 1981: Edward Schatz From 1964 through 1973, Carnegie Mellon did not have a university provost, per se. Instead, President Warner created the position of vice president for academic affairs and chose Edward Schatz to fill that position. As vice president for academic affairs, Schatz led and coordinated the development and improvement of the university's total education program. He played key roles in the merger with the Mellon Institute of Research and in creating the School of Urban and Public Affairs (now Heinz College). The university changed dramatically during Schatz' tenure. The College of Engineering was divided into the Carnegie Institute of Technology and the Mellon College of Science. Margaret Morrison Carnegie College was phased out over the course of several years, and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences (now Dietrich College) was created with departments in English, History, Modern Languages and Psychology. Wean Hall and Warner Hall were constructed, and the student body continued to expand. Faculty members formed the Faculty Senate in 1968 to address major campus issues. In 1973, President Cyert officially reinstituted the Office of the Provost but split the office between two individuals, Schatz and Arnold Weber. Under Cyert, Schatz oversaw all educational matters in the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now College of Engineering) and the College of Fine Arts. Schatz served as interim university president for a short time in 1972 before Cyert took office. While Schatz was provost, the university continued to grow. The Robotics Institute opened and Carnegie Mellon celebrated its first Nobel Laureate, Herb Simon, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978. Schatz was instrumental in bringing the first computers to Carnegie Mellon and encouraged the growth of technology on campus. After serving as provost, Schatz became senior vice president of the university and oversaw large building projects, like the $47 million University Center.

During his tenure as provost, Smith played a large role in developing the Carnegie Plan of Professional Education  the institute's pioneering model of education designed to develop in students the character and ability needed to help them think independently about all aspects of their professional, social and private responsibilities. The curriculum was divided into two parts, scientific and humanistic-social. Engineering and Science students were required to take about one quarter of their classes in the humanistic and social sciences. All courses employed CIT's unique problem-solving focus. Smith also regarded examining and improving undergraduate teaching as his chief objective and was instrumental in founding the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now Tepper School of Business) in 1949. When he retired in 1958, the Board of Trustees commended Smith for his significant contributions to the university through his leadership during the development of a liberal professional education program.
