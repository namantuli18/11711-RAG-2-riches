S. Steel and the USW applicable to USW-represented employees,"" U.S. Steel said. \n\n\n\nThe board cited Nippon\'s written commitments, including a promise not to conduct layoffs during the term of the contract and to invest $1.4 billion in union-represented facilities.  \n\n\n\n""With the arbitration process now behind us, we look forward to moving ahead with our pending transaction with Nippon Steel,"" U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said in a news release. ""With the significant investments and contractual commitments from Nippon Steel, we will protect and grow U. S. Steel for the benefit of our employees, communities and customers. We look forward to collaborative discussions with the USW and all our stakeholders."" \n\n\n\nSale to Nippon faces opposition\n\nWhile U.S. Steel says no further action is required under the basic labor agreement to move forward with closing the sale, the merger faces opposition from President Joe Biden.\n\n\n\nMultiple news outlets have reported that Biden plans to block the deal as soon as he receives a decision from the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS. But the White House has downplayed those reports, saying CIFUS is reviewing the deal for potential national security concerns and could advise against the merger.\n\n\n\nBoth former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have campaigned against the deal. \n\n\n\nBut U.S. Steel has warned that without the deal, thousands of jobs are at risk. And if the sale falls through, U.S. Steel says it ""raises serious questions"" about keeping its headquarters in Pittsburgh. \n\n\n\nThe $15 billion sale to Nippon Steel, Japan\'s largest steelmaker, was announced in December.', 'date': '2024-09-25 18:11:21'}",U.S. Steel's sale to Nippon Steel is proceeding after meeting all obligations under the union's basic labor agreement.
