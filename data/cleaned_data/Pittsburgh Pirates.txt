Roberto ClementePuerto Rican baseball player RobertoClemente, 1968.Pittsburgh PiratesPittsburgh Pirates, American professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Sometimes referredto as the “Bucs,” the Pirates are among the oldest teams in baseball and have won the World Series ﬁve times(1909, 1925, 1960, 1971, and 1979).The team that would become the Pirates was founded as the Pittsburgh Alleghenys in 1882 and played in theAmerican Association before moving to the National League (NL) in 1887. League ofﬁcials accused theAlleghenys of using “piratical” tactics to steal talented players from opposing teams, and the ball club embracedthe label and in 1891 ofﬁcially adopted the name Pirates.Shortstop and Pittsburgh-area native Honus Wagner was among the team’s early standouts, playing with thePirates from 1900 to 1917. The winner of eight batting titles and a member of the ﬁrst group of players inductedinto the Baseball Hall of Fame, Wagner led the Pirates to three straight pennants at the turn of the 20th centuryand to an appearance in the ﬁrst World Series (1903), which Pittsburgh lost to the Boston Red Sox in eight games.The Pirates won their ﬁrst World Series title in 1909, but the team struggled in the 1910s before returning to theWorld Series to defeat the Washington Senators in 1925. They reached the World Series again in 1927 but lost to astandout New York Yankees squad that featured Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.Less-successful years followed, but the Pirates, led by future Hall ofFame member Roberto Clemente, won the 1960 World Seriesdramatically with Bill Mazeroski’s game-winning home run in theninth inning of the seventh game. In the 1970s the Pirates left ForbesField, their home for more than 60 years, to play in Three RiversStadium, where the power hitting of Willie Stargell and Dave Parkerhelped them clinch the NL Eastern Division six times and win WorldSeries championships in 1971 and 1979. In the mid-1980s the Piratesacquired sluggers Barry Bonds and Bobby Bonilla, and the teamﬁnished atop the NL Eastern Division in three consecutive seasons(1990–92) but failed to advance to the World Series each year.Bonds signed with the San Francisco Giants as a free agent after the 1992 season, and the Pirates (who beganplaying in PNC Park in 2001) soon became one of the worst teams in baseball. In 2009 the Pirates had their 17thstraight losing season, a record for a professional franchise in the four major North American sports leagues. Thatstreak extended to 20 consecutive seasons until it was broken in 2013, when the Bucs, led by NL Most ValuablePlayer Andrew McCutchen, won 94 games and earned a berth in the postseason, where the team won the one-game Wild Card playoff but was eliminated in the NL Division Series. Pittsburgh returned to the postseason thefollowing year but was eliminated in the Wild Card Game. In 2015 the team won 98 games—Pittsburgh’s bestseason since the Bonds era and the second most wins in the major leagues that year—but the team was relegated
to the Wild Card contest because of the Pirates residing in the same division as the 100-win St. Louis Cardinals,and the Bucs again lost the one-game playoff. The team’s three-season postseason streak ended in 2016 asPittsburgh posted a losing record. The Pirates continued to struggle in the ensuing years, and in 2021 the team lost101 games.Adam Augustyn
