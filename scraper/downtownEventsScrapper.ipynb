Based on his up-close observations, Bittner gains some keen insight into the behavior of individual birds, giving them names. The resulting portraits of Connor, Mingus, Olive, Pushkin, Picasso, Sophie, and Tupelo prove that these amazing creatures deserve star credit in their own right. Distributed originally by Shadow Distribution, THE WILD PARROTS OF TELEGRAPH HILL, still the 4th highest grossing documentary about animals, flew to over 500 theatrical venues across the country during 2005, including Pittsburgh where it became an unexpected smash hit, playing for many weeks. The film has become a San Francisco classic, and the wild parrot flock \\u2014 now numbering about 300 birds \\u2014 has tourists \\u201cflocking\\u201d to Telegraph Hill, hoping to catch a glimpse of the famous red-and-green birds.\"\n",

The selected works highlight depictions from contemporary urban and rural life, to historical events occurring in, and after Yugoslavia, specifically between the 1980s and today, as photography has mirrored the changes in political and ideological systems and their effects on cultural values. However, at the exhibition\\u2019s core, is the exploration of documentary practices through artworks that are the results of long-term research, demonstrating how photography can capture and decode the ways in which people perceive, and interact with, changing realities. The work of these Serbian artists and collectives encapsulates Serbia\\u2019s transition from a socialist to capitalist state through: personal memories; historical revisionism; the legacy of Yugoslavia\\u2019s industrial heritage; a significant period of isolation during the 1990s when Yugoslavia fell apart; and commentary on life in Serbia today. The range of themes provides diverse perspectives on photography, and allows viewers access to Serbia\\u2019s complex historical, and rich artistic, narratives \\u2013 reinforcing the notion that the human landscape is multifaceted, and that all places across the world are in a constant state of transition. The Wind Got Up in the Night and Took Our Plans Away is accompanied by a monthly film program at the Harris Theater showcasing the work of Serbian documentary filmmakers, and a public art installation by the collective Belgrade Raw in Downtown Pittsburgh\\u2019s alley, Tito Way. 'The Wind Got Up in the Night and Took Our Plans Away' was curated by Miroslav Kari? and Sladjana Petrovi? Varagi?, organized by Rachel Klipa, and presented by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.

The works in this exhibition explore varied and combined themes and symbols related to the apollonian and Dionysian, the lunar and solar, the cult of Orpheus, the rights of Mithras, the writings of Toth Hermes Trismegistus, and the cult of Serpais. Brown received his BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design and MFA from the New York Academy of Art. Following graduation, he was awarded the prestigious Eric Fischl residency where he continued to develop his studio practice. Brown\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s paintings combine traditional techniques and materials with formal design combining the illusion of representational painting against the reality of the material and the painting as an object. This duality is also seen in the mixing of contemporary and ancient subject matter found in his work where the visual themes often focus on subjects of history, myth, and mortality.

Whether it be shouting the magic words from the comfort of your seats or by coming up on stage to be trained as a magical assistant, every member of your party will actively participate throughout the show. Mr. Messado\\u2019s story begins on the TV screen of his grandmother\\u2019s Philadelphia living room where global stars like Michael Jackson and David Copperfield ignited a love for entertainment and storytelling. In this deeply personal, hilarious and engaging performance you\\u2019ll get to know the mister behind the magic, the rabble-rousing raconteur behind the cape, the magic mentor who is Mr. Messado. This unique family friendly matinee takes place each Sunday at Liberty Magic, our one-of-a-kind intimate speakeasy with only 66 seats in 4 rows, typically reserved only for adults. Mr. Messado\\u2019s Magic School for the Young and Young at Heart is recommended for ages 8+. Little brothers and sisters 6 years and older can tag along. No tattletales, snitches, or cheats. Joshua Messado started Messado Magic over 20 years ago at the Houdini\\u2019s magic theatre in Atlantic City, NJ. There he found his passion for performing and discovered the linking rings, which is now his signature effect. After Houdini\\u2019s, he co-owned a magic shop and theatre in Philadelphia, PA for several years. His career in magic led to national and international television appearances as seen on Wizard Wars with Penn and Teller, SyFy Channel (USA), Temple University TV (USA), Illusions of grandeur, OLN (Canada) and recently on Farid Magic 13, Pro7 (Germany). He\\u2019s performed at reputable theatres like the Magic Castle in Hollywood, Chicago Magic Lounge, and Monday Night Magic in New York. He is well equipped with stunning sleight of hand with comedic timing to amaze a wide variety of spectators: corporate shows, college market, resorts, celebrities, adults and children alike. References are ranging from TD Bank, Tropicana Casino to David Copperfield. FAQ: Age Requirements. We have found that kids 5 years of age and under won't understand most of what is happening in this sophisticated magical play, and will probably start to wiggle in their seats because they don't have the attention span to sit and watch\"\n",

            "        \"more_details\": \"This panel discussion with experts in art, architecture, and historic preservation will focus on Virgil Cantini, the Italian-born, Pittsburgh-based visual artist, and his 60 foot long, 28-panel mosaic mural from 1964, which was removed in 2019 from its original site in a pedestrian tunnel. The removal and relocation was coordinated with the involvement of federal, state, and city officials in consultation with concerned citizens and professionals using processes outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. The mosaic panels have since been carefully conserved by McKay Lodge Conservation Laboratory and reinstalled at a new location in the Steel T Plaza Station in Downtown Pittsburgh. During this conversation on one of Pittsburgh\\u2019s most celebrated artists, panelists will provide insight into how the artwork was created, its connection to the Urban Redevelopment Authority\\u2019s mid-20th century redevelopment of the Lower Hill District, and the role the federal and state governments played during the life of the mosaic. Following the discussion, there will be a reception with light refreshments, sponsored by the History Center\\u2019s Italian American Program, Preservation Pittsburgh\\u2019s Modern Committee, and the City of Pittsburgh. The program is free with advance registration. For access to History Center exhibitions, regular admission rates apply. The event will take place in the History Center\\u2019s fifth floor Mueller Center. Virgil David Cantini (1919-2009) was born in Pietransieri, Italy. He immigrated with his family to Weirton, West Virginia in 1930 to escape the rise of Fascism under Mussolini. Artistic and athletic, Cantini was an All-American quarterback and received a football scholarship to play in college. He attended Manhattan College of Technology in New York before transferring to Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). His education was interrupted by World War II when he volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army\\u2019s Engineering Corps as a modelmaker and topographer. He returned from his service in 1946, graduated from college, and married fellow artist Lucille Kleber. They lived and worked in their home on South Craig Street in Oakland, raising two daughters. In 1948, Cantini earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Pittsburgh, where he later taught and helped to create the Fine Arts Department. He chaired the department until his retirement in 1989. He became an Associate Professor of Fine Art at the University of Pittsburgh in the early 1950s after teaching ceramics for four years at Schenley High School. His local and national profile grew as he participated in group and solo exhibitions. He was named one of Time Magazine\\u2019s \\u201cLeaders of Tomorrow\\u201d in 1953 and won the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts\\u2019 Artist of the Year in 1956. Cantini was active among professional organizations, such as the Sculpture Society, the Craftsmen Guild, and the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh. He won a Guggenheim Fellowship to return to Europe to study his craft in 1957 and the Pope Paul VI Bishop\\u2019s Medal in 1964 for his contributions to liturgical art.

Fleetwood will discuss how art can heal and humanize in the age of mass incarceration. More than two million people are currently behind bars in the United States. According to Dr. Nicole R. Fleetwood, incarceration not only separates the imprisoned from their families and communities, but it exposes them to deprivation, abuse, and arbitrary cruelties of the criminal justice system. Despite that, many of America\\u2019s prisons are filled with art. Despite the isolation and degradation they may experience, the incarcerated are driven to assert their humanity in the face of a system that dehumanizes them. A MacArthur Genius Fellow, curator, art critic, and author of the award-winning \\u201cMarking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration,\\u201d Dr. Nicole R. Fleetwood will reveal her unique perspective on how the imprisoned use art to express the visual culture of incarceration and its current impact on contemporary art.

The duo met in 1997 married in 1998 started a family and a group pretty simultaneously and started performing in Philly in a small club called the Five spot with an event called the Black Lily. The pivotal moment came when they met Steve McKeever the president of Hidden Beach Recordings who signed them and the Neo-soul movement of that era spawned a few artists who went on to be successful like Bilal, Jill Scott, Floetry, Musiq SoulChild Ledisi and a few others. The duo has also been nominated for awards such as BET and Soul Train but cites their biggest accomplishment as the sustainability of their art together as a unit and operating independently for more than 10 years in the murky and turbulent circuit of the Music Industry. In 2015 Kindred was highlighted in a Walmart commercial with their entire family in a very successful summer campaign. The versatile duo has also performed a record number of 8 times at Essence Festival and over the years have done countless tours with many of the major artist in the music industry while accumulating several top ten R&B records including \\u201cFar Away\\u201d, \\u201cStars\\u201d, \\u201cWhere would I Be\\u201d, \\u201cAll My People\\u201d and more.

Hailing from five continents, all now living and working in Pittsburgh, the artists are each presenting an installation informed by their diverse studio practices, utilizing a broad range of mediums, from textiles and collages to video essays and digital sculpture. Where traditional mapmaking creates rigid understandings of constructs like nationhood, gender, and language, this exhibition offers fluid systems of way-finding between shifting and interlaced worlds. A dance is re-choreographed, an altar calls the past into the present, discarded objects find a new sense of value, and sensory fragments from childhood are restaged. Memory plays a vital role across the works on view, exploring how a body can chart through space on its own terms. Artists: Izsys Archer (MFA \\u201825) Naomi Chambers (MFA \\u201826) Tingting Chen (MFA \\u201825) Chantal Feitosa-Desouza (MFA \\u201825) Frankmarlin (MFA \\u201825) Bulumko Mbete (MFA \\u201826) Afrooz Partovi (MFA \\u201826) Max Tristan Watkins (MFA \\u201825) This is not a map is presented by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University.

The selected works highlight depictions from contemporary urban and rural life, to historical events occurring in, and after Yugoslavia, specifically between the 1980s and today, as photography has mirrored the changes in political and ideological systems and their effects on cultural values. However, at the exhibition\\u2019s core, is the exploration of documentary practices through artworks that are the results of long-term research, demonstrating how photography can capture and decode the ways in which people perceive, and interact with, changing realities. The work of these Serbian artists and collectives encapsulates Serbia\\u2019s transition from a socialist to capitalist state through: personal memories; historical revisionism; the legacy of Yugoslavia\\u2019s industrial heritage; a significant period of isolation during the 1990s when Yugoslavia fell apart; and commentary on life in Serbia today. The range of themes provides diverse perspectives on photography, and allows viewers access to Serbia\\u2019s complex historical, and rich artistic, narratives \\u2013 reinforcing the notion that the human landscape is multifaceted, and that all places across the world are in a constant state of transition. The Wind Got Up in the Night and Took Our Plans Away is accompanied by a monthly film program at the Harris Theater showcasing the work of Serbian documentary filmmakers, and a public art installation by the collective Belgrade Raw in Downtown Pittsburgh\\u2019s alley, Tito Way. 'The Wind Got Up in the Night and Took Our Plans Away' was curated by Miroslav Kari? and Sladjana Petrovi? Varagi?, organized by Rachel Klipa, and presented by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. This project is fiscally sponsored by the New York Foundation for the Arts, with funding from The Heinz Endowments, and the Trust for Mutual Understanding. Also with thanks to Silver Eye Center for Photography.\"\n",

The works in this exhibition explore varied and combined themes and symbols related to the apollonian and Dionysian, the lunar and solar, the cult of Orpheus, the rights of Mithras, the writings of Toth Hermes Trismegistus, and the cult of Serpais. Brown received his BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design and MFA from the New York Academy of Art. Following graduation, he was awarded the prestigious Eric Fischl residency where he continued to develop his studio practice. Brown\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122s paintings combine traditional techniques and materials with formal design combining the illusion of representational painting against the reality of the material and the painting as an object. This duality is also seen in the mixing of contemporary and ancient subject matter found in his work where the visual themes often focus on subjects of history, myth, and mortality. Zach actively exhibits throughout the United States having his work covered by Artnet News and Hi-Fructose. His work has been added to the Seavest Group Collection and The Iliana Goor Museum in Tel Aviv as well as being a permanent feature of the Satanic Temple of Salem. Zach Brown is presented by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. Special thanks to Kennedy Deen, lead art installer for the exhibition.\"\n",

Join superstar magician Mr. Messado for his new astonishing play designed exclusively for Liberty Magic. Time tested through thousands of performances at appearances around the world, schools, company events, private parties and more, Mr. Messado\\u2019s Magic School for the Young and Young at Heart will have both teens AND adults amazed from start to finish! This 60 minute spectacular, featuring a combination of stunning magic and clean comedy, is full of interactive wonder. Whether it be shouting the magic words from the comfort of your seats or by coming up on stage to be trained as a magical assistant, every member of your party will actively participate throughout the show. Mr. Messado\\u2019s story begins on the TV screen of his grandmother\\u2019s Philadelphia living room where global stars like Michael Jackson and David Copperfield ignited a love for entertainment and storytelling. In this deeply personal, hilarious and engaging performance you\\u2019ll get to know the mister behind the magic, the rabble-rousing raconteur behind the cape, the magic mentor who is Mr. Messado. This unique family friendly matinee takes place each Sunday at Liberty Magic, our one-of-a-kind intimate speakeasy with only 66 seats in 4 rows, typically reserved only for adults. Mr. Messado\\u2019s Magic School for the Young and Young at Heart is recommended for ages 8+. Little brothers and sisters 6 years and older can tag along. No tattletales, snitches, or cheats. Joshua Messado started Messado Magic over 20 years ago at the Houdini\\u2019s magic theatre in Atlantic City, NJ. There he found his passion for performing and discovered the linking rings, which is now his signature effect. After Houdini\\u2019s, he co-owned a magic shop and theatre in Philadelphia, PA for several years. His career in magic led to national and international television appearances as seen on Wizard Wars with Penn and Teller, SyFy Channel (USA), Temple University TV (USA), Illusions of grandeur, OLN (Canada) and recently on Farid Magic 13, Pro7 (Germany). He\\u2019s performed at reputable theatres like the Magic Castle in Hollywood, Chicago Magic Lounge, and Monday Night Magic in New York. He is well equipped with stunning sleight of hand with comedic timing to amaze a wide variety of spectators: corporate shows, college market, resorts, celebrities, adults and children alike. References are ranging from TD Bank, Tropicana Casino to David Copperfield. FAQ: Age Requirements. We have found that kids 5 years of age and under won't understand most of what is happening in this sophisticated magical play, and will probably start to wiggle in their seats because they don't have the attention span to sit and watch\"\n",

Trapped in a Japanese POW camp in Burma, obsessive British Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness, in an Oscar-winning role) wants order and a strict adherence to the rule of law, so much so that he is blind to the Japanese commander's request to build the eponymous bridge--an act that Nicholson believes follows the rule of law and will instill discipline on his men, while ignoring the fact that it will help the enemy. Meanwhile, American Commander Shears (William Holden) escapes the same camp, eventually leading a commando force to return and destroy Nicholson's engineering miracle. At once a gorgeous, sweeping epic, director Lean's experience with intimate romances also brings us close to the pain, suffering, and even humor of the men who survive the POW camp.

The architecture still communicates a past idea of the future, while the materials reveal the current state of the building. Through their relentless effort, the maintenance workers shoulder the duty of restoring the space to what it was imagined to be. Their movements are rituals, but also their own. SPEAK So I Can See You (2019) | 73 mins | a film by Marija Stojnic Conjuring reality and wonder, SPEAK So I Can See You takes us to a seemingly different era, by exploring the world of Radio Belgrade. One of Europe\\u2019s oldest radio stations and a true institution of the city, the station still broadcasts original programming and helps keep history, culture, and critical thought, as well as ever-relevant questions about ourselves and the world, from slipping out of memory and mind. Set at the intersection of an observational documentary and a unique sensory experience, the film conjures everyday scenes at the station and immersing interludes exploring the relationship between sound and the space it inhabits. Through a synesthetic blend of sounds, words, notes, echoes and light, we are taken into a unique cinematic soundscape that doubles as a love letter to radiophonic art and its disarming insight into what makes us remember, understand, think, discover, and feel.

A Jason Isbell record always lands like a decoder ring in the ears and hearts of his audience, a soundtrack to his world and magically to theirs, too. Weathervanes carries the same revelatory power. This is a storyteller at the peak of his craft, observing his fellow wanderers, looking inside and trying to understand, reducing a universe to four minutes. He shrinks life small enough to name the fear and then strip it away, helping his listeners make sense of how two plus two stops equaling four once you reach a certain age -- and carry a certain amount of scars. \\u201cThere is something about boundaries on this record,\\u201d Isbell says. \\u201cAs you mature, you still attempt to keep the ability to love somebody fully and completely while you\\u2019re growing into an adult and learning how to love yourself.\\u201d Weathervanes is a collection of grown-up songs: Songs about adult love, about change, about the danger of nostalgia and the interrogation of myths, about cruelty and regret and redemption. Life and death songs played for and by grown ass people. Some will make you cry alone in your car and others will make you sing along with thousands of strangers in a big summer pavilion, united in the great miracle of being alive. The record features the rolling thunder of Isbell\\u2019s fearsome 400 Unit, who\\u2019ve earned a place in the rock \\u2018n\\u2019 roll cosmos alongside the greatest backing ensembles, as powerful and essential to the storytelling as The E Street Band or the Wailers. They make a big noise, as Isbell puts it, and he feels so comfortable letting them be a main prism through which much of the world hears his art. He can be private but with them behind him he transforms, and there is a version of himself that can only exist in their presence. When he plays a solo show, he is in charge of the entire complicated juggle. On stage with the 400 Unit, he can be a guitar hero when he wants, and a conductor when he wants, and a smiling fan of the majesty of his bandmates when he wants to hang back and listen to the sound. The roots of this record go back into the isolation of the pandemic and to Isbell\\u2019s recent time on the set as an actor on Martin Scorsese\\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon. There were guitars in his trailer and in his rented house and a lot of time to sit and think. The melancholy yet soaring track \\u201cKing of Oklahoma\\u201d was written there. Isbell also watched the great director work, saw the relationship between a clear vision and its execution, and perhaps most important, saw how even someone as decorated as Scorsese sought out and used his co-workers\\u2019 opinions. \\u201cIt definitely helped when I got into the studio,\\u201d Isbell says. \\u201cI had this reinvigorated sense of collaboration.

The Rosamunde String Quartet was founded in 2015 so that its members could pursue their passion for the string quartet repertoire. Its members include young stars from three of the world\\u2019s greatest orchestras: Noah Bendix-Balgley, 1st concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic; Shanshan Yao, concert violinist and former member of the Pittsburgh Symphony and New York Philharmonic; Teng Li, principal violist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic; and Nathan Vickery, cellist in the New York Philharmonic. They take time away from their international careers to create music together. Each member is an accomplished soloist and musician, and brings a unique voice to the ensemble. By uniting their experiences, they create a distinctive sound and unanimity of expression. Above all, they hugely enjoy sharing their love of chamber music with each other and with audiences. www.rosamundestringquartet.com\"\n",

Where traditional mapmaking creates rigid understandings of constructs like nationhood, gender, and language, this exhibition offers fluid systems of way-finding between shifting and interlaced worlds. A dance is re-choreographed, an altar calls the past into the present, discarded objects find a new sense of value, and sensory fragments from childhood are restaged. Memory plays a vital role across the works on view, exploring how a body can chart through space on its own terms.

The selected works highlight depictions from contemporary urban and rural life, to historical events occurring in, and after Yugoslavia, specifically between the 1980s and today, as photography has mirrored the changes in political and ideological systems and their effects on cultural values. However, at the exhibition\\u2019s core, is the exploration of documentary practices through artworks that are the results of long-term research, demonstrating how photography can capture and decode the ways in which people perceive, and interact with, changing realities. The work of these Serbian artists and collectives encapsulates Serbia\\u2019s transition from a socialist to capitalist state through: personal memories; historical revisionism; the legacy of Yugoslavia\\u2019s industrial heritage; a significant period of isolation during the 1990s when Yugoslavia fell apart; and commentary on life in Serbia today. The range of themes provides diverse perspectives on photography, and allows viewers access to Serbia\\u2019s complex historical, and rich artistic, narratives \\u2013 reinforcing the notion that the human landscape is multifaceted, and that all places across the world are in a constant state of transition. The Wind Got Up in the Night and Took Our Plans Away is accompanied by a monthly film program at the Harris Theater showcasing the work of Serbian documentary filmmakers, and a public art installation by the collective Belgrade Raw in Downtown Pittsburgh\\u2019s alley, Tito Way. 'The Wind Got Up in the Night and Took Our Plans Away' was curated by Miroslav Kari? and Sladjana Petrovi? Varagi?, organized by Rachel Klipa, and presented by the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust.

This Could be True , a new one-act by Charles David \\u201cStoney\\u201d Richards who also penned last season\\u2019s indoor comedy, \\u201cShakespeare: The First Drafts.\\u201d Richards says: \\u201c This Could be True is a one-act play about an Actor confined to an insane asylum as he suffers from Misidentification Syndrome and Auditory Hallucinations believing he is a member of Shakespeare\\u2019s company. He thinks the people speaking to him are someone else.

As a playwright he was a remarkable rewrite artist. He was able to find stories that many people of his day were already familiar with; Hamlet, Henry V and Macbeth, to name a few. He rewrote them with his own sense of drama , responsibility and the conflicts of life, death, love, all subjects that appealed to his audience\\u2019s taste.

Through the course of this play much is revealed about Shakespeare, the real life character Jon Sincler and the mental maze this illness can create in the human mind. Narrator Harper York asks: \\u201cHas this ever happened?\\u201d Richards responds that all we can say is \\u201cThis Could be True!\\u201d Actors appearing in THIS COULD BE TRUE:  Charles David \\u201cStoney\\u201d Richards returns as both playwright and actor in his own new play.

Led by the National Museum of African American History\\u2019s Center for the Study of African American Religious Life in association with the Pew Research Center, the documentary is the culmination of a five-year study exploring the lives of seven Black millennials who identify as Atheist, Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, If\\u00e1, and Spiritualist and how they have reimagined faith in the 21st century. The rise of the \\u201cspiritual but not religious\\u201d designation has led to a decline of millennial participation in mainline religious traditions with many questioning the relevance, mission, and overall purpose of organized religion in the 21st century. From issues pertaining to gender and sexuality, abuse and trauma, hip-hop culture and music, gentrification, race and racism, patriarchy, and more, the film explores a rising phenomenon of religious and spiritual shifts among the largest generation and one of the most influential demographics in the U.S., Black millennials. Following the screening, a panel discussion featuring the film producer and director will take place.

Styled as the father of American ballet, he co-founded the New York City Ballet and remained its artistic director for more than 35 years. His choreography is characterized by plotless ballets with minimal costume and d\\u00e9cor, performed to classical and neoclassical music. Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, Balanchine took the standards and technique from his time at the Imperial Ballet School and fused it with other schools of movement that he had adopted during his tenure on Broadway and in Hollywood, creating his signature \\\"neoclassical style\\u201d. He was a choreographer known for his musicality; he expressed music with dance and worked extensively with leading composers of his time like Igor Stravinsky. Balanchine was invited to America in 1933 by a young arts patron named Lincoln Kirstein, and together they founded the School of American Ballet in 1934 as well as the New York City Ballet in 1948. Bob Fosse was an American actor, choreographer, dancer, and film and stage director. He directed and choreographed musical works on stage and screen, including the stage musicals The Pajama Game (1954), Damn Yankees (1955), How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1961), Sweet Charity (1966), Pippin (1972), and Chicago (1975). He directed the films Sweet Charity (1969), Cabaret (1972), Lenny (1975), All That Jazz (1979), and Star 80 (1983). Fosse's distinctive style of choreography included turned-in knees and \\\"jazz hands\\\". He is the only person ever to have won Oscar, Emmy, and Tony awards in the same year (1973). He was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning Best Director for Cabaret , and won the Palme D'Or in 1980 for All That Jazz. He won a record eight Tonys for his choreography, as well as one for direction for Pippin . Martha Graham was an American modern dancer and choreographer. Her style, the Graham technique, reshaped American dance and is still taught worldwide. Graham danced and taught for over seventy years. She was the first dancer to perform at the White House, travel abroad as a cultural ambassador, and receive the highest civilian award of the US: the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction. In her lifetime she received honors ranging from the Key to the City of Paris to Japan's Imperial Order of the Precious Crown. She said, in the 1994 documentary The Dancer Revealed : \\\"I have spent all my life with dance and being a dancer. It's permitting life to use you in a very intense way. Sometimes it is not pleasant. Sometimes it is fearful. But nevertheless it is inevitable.\\u201d Founded in 1926 (the same year as Graham's professional dance company), the Martha Graham School is the oldest school of dance in the United States. First located in a small studio within Carnegie Hall, the school currently has two different studios in New York City.

Jarrett Ross , also known as the Genea Vlogger, began seriously researching his own family history in 2009 while finishing his undergraduate degree at the University of Pittsburgh. Since then he has successfully connected with thousands of relatives all over the World, helped build hundreds of trees for people of varying ancestral backgrounds, and has worked on hundreds of genealogical projects of varying types. Jarrett has found a specialty in Genetic Genealogy and Sephardic Jewish research with an emphasis on the Portuguese Jewish Community of Amsterdam. Jarrett\\u2019s other main focuses of research are in Jewish Agricultural Societies of Southern New Jersey, Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry in the Pale of Settlement, Jews in America, and Jews in Ukraine. Along with his areas of focus, Jarrett also has extensive experience with research in a variety of ancestral backgrounds from all over the World, including an array of experience in genetic genealogy. Jarrett spent just under 5 years working as the Lead Forensic Genealogist at DNA Labs International, helping create investigative leads to identify unknown human remains and perpetrators of violent crimes. In October 2023, Jarrett left the Forensic industry to pursue a content creation and genealogy education full-time. \"\n",

Romero\\u2019s Dawn of the Dead (1978) is still not available on any streaming platform, nor on cable, and has been out-of-print on DVD and Blu-ray in the U.S. for over a decade, so the hunger to watch it just keeps growing among its ravenous fans. Furthermore, the cult following for the film has grown exponentially since its release and is so large now it is estimated that over 80% of Dawn of the Dead\\u2019s fans have never experienced this legendary epic in a theatre. That all changes starting now! Writer-director George A. Romero ups the ante on his indie landmark NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD with a bigger budget, more gore (courtesy of special effects/makeup artist Tom Savini) and a touch of social commentary. Four people take refuge in a Pennsylvania shopping mall as a mysterious plague turns fresh corpses into flesh-hungry zombies and civilization collapses around them. \\u201cOne of the best horror films ever made.\\u201d \\u2013 Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times.

Roger Humphries began playing professionally at the age of fourteen. He led his own group at Carnegie Music Hall when just sixteen. \\\"I've had a love for music as long as I can remember.\\\" He was encouraged by his older brothers Lawrence Jr. and Norman who were musicians at that time. Additionally, Roger's son Roger Jr. and Norman's son Gregory have followed in their footsteps as professional drummers. After playing with various groups around the country, Humphries decided to organize his own group in 1972 which he calls RH Factor and in 1996 he assembled Roger Humphries' Big Band. Roger gives special thanks to Dr. Harry Clark, principal of The Pittsburgh High School for the Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA) who has allowed him to have such a beautiful experience teaching the kids at the school, and also to Dr. Nathan Davis who gave him an opportunity to teach and shares lives with students at the University of Pittsburgh. Roger has influenced the careers of a number of his students and musicians also through participation in a number of clinics such as the Slippery Rock University Summer Jazz workshop, Mellon Jazz Masters Class and Concerts, and the teaching goes on especially on the stage.\"\n",

With an estimated global population of 10^31 and unprecedented genetic diversity, phages impact everything from the global carbon cycle to our food supply. This talk will trace the scientific and historical impact of bacteriophages from 1915 through today and beyond About Welkin Pope A native Cape Codder, Welkin Pope earned a BS in Biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a PhD in Biological Oceanography from the Joint Program between MIT and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where her work focused on a marine bacterial virus (a bacteriophage) in the laboratory of Jonathan King. After graduate school, Pope moved to Pittsburgh to study the structure and diversity of bacteriophages at the University of Pittsburgh with Roger Hendrix. She joined the research faculty at Pitt in 2012. She also served as the Science Coordinator for the course-based authentic research and education program SEA-PHAGES under the leadership of Pitt professor Graham Hatfull, a program which has been adopted by more than 100 institutions globally and engaged 1000s of students. In 2020, Pope joined the faculty at Chatham University, where she continues to study the structure and genomic diversity of bacterial viruses, and to pursue her interest in STEM education research. Outside of science, she enjoys spending time with her husband, her two children, and their two dogs; taking adult dance classes, reading science fiction novels, building with LEGO bricks, hiking in the woods, and seeing local live theater.\"\n",

Approaching each work through an intuitive art making practice, Townes\\u2019 process of layering vibrant colors, glitter, and resin, is meant to mirror the complex nature of Black women's oneness in challenging spaces while investigating the experience of intersectional feminism. By painting directly onto raw wood surfaces, she references the aesthetics and graphic style of street art culture, conveying the sense of its power by figuratively and literally taking up space.

Artist biography: Kamara Townes, known professionally as Wavy Wednesday, is an artist, muralist and activist based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her work highlights the more playful aspects of her experiences as a Black feminist artist and incorporates elements of pop culture, street art, and Afrofuturism to confront and comment on social, racial, and gender justice. Her multidisciplinary practice, which encompasses painting, sculpture, murals, and installations have been celebrated and featured in several public art projects in the city of Pittsburgh, published in Brian Burley\\u2019s \\u201cYNGBLKPGH,\\u201d and shared widely on popular social media sites including Afropunk and Supermarket Magazine. Townes received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from California University of Pennsylvania and is currently pursuing a Master of Fine Arts degree with a focus in painting at West Virginia University.

History of Magic: Part 1 is a sketch comedy show featuring magic, singing, stage combat, sideshow, and more to satirize magic from its birth in 2700BC all the way up to modern day. We should also mention that it is written by and starring two multi-talented and award-winning performers who happen to be chaotically good friends and partners-in-crime: Hayden Allcorn and Naathan Phan. They have performed, separately, on TV shows, cruise ships, and stages across the globe and are uniting to bring us a show that they've been working on for over 5 years. What makes Naathan Phan different from other entertainers? He combines his passions for magic, singing, stand-up, vocal mimicry, writing, acting, classic cocktails, suits, and more into one unforgettable experience. Add to that his sincerity, high energy, and natural +10 to charisma and it's easy to see why he's been featured on America's Got Talent, The Hollywood Christmas Parade, Wizard Wars, Don't Blink, Superbad, Penn & Teller: Fool Us, and the last 8 consecutive seasons of Masters of Illusion.

Thousands fleeing persecution and expulsions across Western Europe came. As Poland expanded to the east and south, Jews moved into Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian lands. By 1800 there were more than a million Jews in the Pale. By 1900, they would number nearly five million. Jews flourished in the Pale, creating diverse religious, cultural, educational, and charitable institutions. Then, between 1881 and 1914 over two million left all that they had known for the West. This talk discusses how the Pale came to be, life in it and why this mass migration occurred. It breaks the 120-year history of the Pale into periods of creation, confinement, repression, enlightenment, pogroms, and chaos. There is much more to the story than the horrific pogroms at the turn of the 20th century. Additional brief talk, \\u201cMy 5th Great Grandfather\\u2019s Name\\u201d The oldest family documentation that I have found is the 1850 Russian Revision List (census) for Dubno which lists my 3rd great-grandfather (who had died in 1848) and my 2nd great-grandfather (who, as a young man, was now head of the family). Unlike censuses, revision lists included information on residents who had died since the previous revision list. Based on the patronymic middle name of my 3rd great-grandfather, I had the name, if nothing more, of my 4th great-grandfather. The records office in Dubno, where the Bookbinders lived, was destroyed during World War II and all records contained there were lost. The regional archive in Rivne has no earlier records. So far as I know, no records exist for my 5th great-grandfather. So, I developed a hypothesis as to his name and the approximate dates of his birth and death. You might use the technique that I employed to do the same when no records can be found. This program is possible through the generous support of the William M. Lowenstein Genealogical Research Endowment Fund of the Jewish Community Foundation. \\u201cWhy did our Jewish ancestors leave the Pale?\\u201d is a collaboration between the Jewish Genealogy Society of Pittsburgh and the Rauh Jewish Archives at the Heinz History Center.

Workers from field to country unite to form volunteer Guerrilla armies to face the ruthless Black and Tan squads, who are blocking Ireland\\u2019s bid for Independence. Driven by a deep sense of duty and a love for his country, Damien O\\u2019Sullivan (Cillian Murphy, who recently won an Oscar for his performance in OPPENHEIMER), abandons his burgeoning career as a doctor and joins his brother, Teddy (Padraic Delaney), and committed trade unionist Dan (Liam Cunningham) in a dangerous and violent fight for Ireland\\u2019s freedom. As the freedom fighters\\u2019 bold tactics bring the British to breaking point, both sides finally agree to a treaty to end the bloodshed. But, despite the apparent victory, civil war erupts and families, who fought side by side, find themselves pitted against one another as sworn enemies, putting their loyalties to the ultimate test. In this film Loach offers a powerful cinematic vision of Irish history, which focuses on questions of nation and revolution through the eyes of a community; and the film\\u2019s tale remains highly resonant throughout the world today.

These three films span Loach's amazing career and present a chance to do a deep dive into the politics and style of a filmmaker who has always stood by his principles above all else. The Old Oak is the last pub standing in a once thriving mining village in northern England, a gathering space for a community that has fallen on hard times. There is growing anger, resentment, and a lack of hope among the residents, but the pub and its proprietor TJ are a fond presence to their customers. When a group of Syrian refugees move into the floundering village, a decisive rift fueled by prejudices develops between the community and its newest inhabitants. The formation of an unexpected friendship between TJ and a young Syrian woman named Yara opens up new possibilities for the divided village in this deeply moving drama about loss, fear, and the difficulty of finding hope. Loach, who is 87 years old, has announced that The Old Oak will be his final film. Directed by Ken Loach 2023 | United Kingdom | English language with English subtitles | DCP\"\n",

Painted in an Afrofuturist style, Townes\\u2019 autobiographical works serve as a rigorous commentary of Black identity, depicting representations that range from being adequately rebellious to thoroughly politically engaged and enraged. Approaching each work through an intuitive art making practice, Townes\\u2019 process of layering vibrant colors, glitter, and resin, is meant to mirror the complex nature of Black women's oneness in challenging spaces while investigating the experience of intersectional feminism. By painting directly onto raw wood surfaces, she references the aesthetics and graphic style of street art culture, conveying the sense of its power by figuratively and literally taking up space. By exposing the beauty in raw, and sometimes distressed materials, she calls attention to the act of physical construction and the social construction of unapologetic Black women represented in these works. Artist biography: Kamara Townes, known professionally as Wavy Wednesday, is an artist, muralist and activist based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her work highlights the more playful aspects of her experiences as a Black feminist artist and incorporates elements of pop culture, street art, and Afrofuturism to confront and comment on social, racial, and gender justice. Her multidisciplinary practice, which encompasses painting, sculpture, murals, and installations have been celebrated and featured in several public art projects in the city of Pittsburgh, published in Brian Burley\\u2019s \\u201cYNGBLKPGH,\\u201d and shared widely on popular social media sites including Afropunk and Supermarket Magazine. Townes received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from California University of Pennsylvania and is currently pursuing a Master of Fine Arts degree with a focus in painting at West Virginia University.

We should also mention that it is written by and starring two multi-talented and award-winning performers who happen to be chaotically good friends and partners-in-crime: Hayden Allcorn and Naathan Phan. They have performed, separately, on TV shows, cruise ships, and stages across the globe and are uniting to bring us a show that they've been working on for over 5 years. What makes Naathan Phan different from other entertainers? He combines his passions for magic, singing, stand-up, vocal mimicry, writing, acting, classic cocktails, suits, and more into one unforgettable experience. Add to that his sincerity, high energy, and natural +10 to charisma and it's easy to see why he's been featured on America's Got Talent, The Hollywood Christmas Parade, Wizard Wars, Don't Blink, Superbad, Penn & Teller: Fool Us, and the last 8 consecutive seasons of Masters of Illusion.

In this deeply personal, hilarious and engaging performance you\\u2019ll get to know the mister behind the magic, the rabble-rousing raconteur behind the cape, the magic mentor who is Mr. Messado.

There he found his passion for performing and discovered the linking rings, which is now his signature effect. After Houdini\\u2019s, he co-owned a magic shop and theatre in Philadelphia, PA for several years. His career in magic led to national and international television appearances as seen on Wizard Wars with Penn and Teller, SyFy Channel (USA), Temple University TV (USA), Illusions of grandeur, OLN (Canada) and recently on Farid Magic 13, Pro7 (Germany). He\\u2019s performed at reputable theatres like the Magic Castle in Hollywood, Chicago Magic Lounge, and Monday Night Magic in New York. He is well equipped with stunning sleight of hand with comedic timing to amaze a wide variety of spectators: corporate shows, college market, resorts, celebrities, adults and children alike.

We have found that kids 5 years of age and under won't understand most of what is happening in this sophisticated magical play, and will probably start to wiggle in their seats because they don't have the attention span to sit and watch\"\n",

Lacy (Zoe Ziegler), navigating the summer vacation between fifth and sixth grade, yearns to\\u2014but also fears to\\u2014escape the orbit of her mother Janet (Julianne Nicholson, Mare of Easttown ) as she leaves childhood. It\\u2019s been just the two of them, you see, but then three satellites enter, then leave, the picture: Will Patton ( Wendy and Lucy ) as an aspiring boyfriend, Sophie Okonedo ( Hotel Rwanda ) as an old friend, and Elias Koteas ( Exotica ) as the head of a spacey theatre troupe. The screenplay gestated in Baker\\u2019s mind and heart for decades\\u2014\\u201cIt was kind of the first idea for a movie I ever had,\\u201d she revealed\\u2014drawing deeply on the milieu she grew up in, the woods of western Massachusetts. Nicholson did too, though not until they met during casting did the two discover their childhood proximity (\\u201cWe shopped at the same stores and swam in the same ponds,\\u201d Baker said in an interview). No score, just nature sounds, keeps the focus entirely on the mother and daughter in this hyper-subtle character study; sound designer Paul Hsu has said Janet Planet was the quietest movie he\\u2019s ever worked on.

Adapting Herman Wouk's Pulitzer Prize\\u2013winning 1951 novel, producer Stanley Kramer and director Edward Dmytryk craft an incisive examination of power and its institutions, and the unfolding and resolution of a crisis in leadership. The film's first half aboard the Caine establishes the reality of life on a wartime destroyer minesweeper, while the final acts shift to the court martial hearing against the junior officers accused of mutiny, resulting in one of the screen's all-time-great courtroom dramas.

Shot in 1967 with a miniscule budget, a novice\\u2019s faith, a wild passion, and with over 60 of Greene\\u2019s CMU School of Drama classmates, this meandering narrative reflects a moment in time and place of bohemian youth without real purpose other than scoring enough cash for their next party.\",\n",

Come Back Baby was shot in the shadow of Forbes Field and the movie unfolds across a recognizable Pittsburgh landscape. Events primarily take place in and around a South Bouquet St. apartment and include numerous street scenes where the stadium and other city landmarks feature prominently. This is a distinctively Pittsburgh film, and it was selected by Jonas Mekas for national exhibition via Filmmakers Distribution Center. Yet the movie failed to make a lasting impression upon limited release in 1968. Aside from a smattering of TV screenings over the subsequent decade, it has been completely unavailable. Now the only known 16mm print has been digitally scanned, and, for the first time in many decades, Come Back Baby returns. P David Greene and film historian Michael Prosser will join us for discussion of the film after the screening.

Distance: Participants should not expect to cover a long distance for this trip \\u2013 likely between 0.5 and 1.0 miles overall. We will depart from the launch, do some light paddling around the Point area (unable to cross the river to the Point due to the fireworks safety zone), and then remain on the water for the show.

The presentation will include online sources and documents not yet online for both the United States and Europe; she will also cover some basic knowledge critical to researching one\\u2019s Jewish roots. 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. Break (no lunch provided) Second Session 1 p.m.-3 p.m. \\u201cDefying Expectations: The Story of a Jewish Woman Who Took on the Russian Empire.\\u201d Chava Lefand (1797-1884) lived in a time when we\\u2019d expect a woman to not be well-represented in documentation. And in fact, looking at traditional genealogical documents gives little information about Chava and the life she lived. But Chava\\u2019s story shows how much can be learned by looking at non-traditional documentation to learn about an individual and the context in which they lived. Chava had already lost two children to mandatory conscription into the Russian Empire, and she refused to lose another. The widowed mother filed a series of petitions throughout the 1850s which went as high as two Czars and the Governing Senate (the Russian Empire\\u2019s Supreme Court equivalent). In doing this, she generated a genealogical gold mine (telling of secret marriages and here various relatives were living or hiding from the draft) and gave her perspective on family and community gossip and conflict. While this is the talk about one woman (the speaker\\u2019s 5th great grandmother), her hundreds of pages of petitions and appeals tell her perspective of how Jewish families dealt with mandatory conscription of their young children, how conscription caused strife within the Jewish community and formed a hierarchy (she felt she wasn\\u2019t part of the cool kids\\u2019 clique), and how relatively simple Jewish families were able to generate a significant amount of documentation in the mid-1800s. This program is possible through the generous support of the William M. Lowenstein Genealogical Research Endowment Fund of the Jewish Community Foundation. \\u201cJewish Genealogy Day\\u201d is a collaboration between the Jewish Genealogy Society of Pittsburgh and the Rauh Jewish Archives at the Heinz History Center.

She has traced all branches of her family multiple generations back in Eastern Europe using Russian Empire-era and Austria-Hungarian Empire records. Most of her personal research is in modern-day Ukraine, with a smattering of Belarus and Poland. She has done client research leading to their ancestors in many parts of the former USSR, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and more. She is president of the Jewish Genealogy Society of Maryland and is JewishGen\\u2019s Subcarpathia Research Director. She has lectured around the country and internationally on Jewish and Eastern European genealogy research as well as genetic genealogy.

Joining Chesney is the multiple GRAMMY-winning Zac Brown Band , enjoying their 12th CMA Group of the Year nomination; 2023 CMA Song of the Year and New Artist nominee Megan Moroney ; and multiple-week No. 1 \\u201cWhen The Sun Goes Down\\u201d duet partner Uncle Kracker , known for his own hits \\u201cFollow Me\\u201d and \\u201cDrift Away.\\u201d \\u201cI wanted a name that suggested \\u2013 obviously \\u2013 when all the good stuff starts to happen. The one thing I\\u2019ve learned about No Shoes Nation and these stadium shows is they start the good times early and they just keep it going,\\u201d Chesney says of his 2024 tour name. \\u201cBut we all know, when the sun goes down, that\\u2019s when people really get loose and enjoy themselves. \\u201cThat was the thing about Kracker and my song.

No matter how much fun you\\u2019re having all day long, \\u2018 everything gets hotter when the sun goes down...\\u2019 I know from years of experience that\\u2019s true. \\u201cSo, I can\\u2019t wait to get back out there, stadium-sized \\u2019cause there\\u2019s nothing like 60,000 members of No Shoes Nation singing these songs. It\\u2019s gonna be awesome.\\u201d Kicking off April 20, 2024 at Tampa\\u2019s Raymond James Stadium, the tour will run through August 23 at Foxborough, Mass.\\u2019s Gillette Stadium for what has become a tradition: closing out the tour in a venue Chesney has played to well over a million people.

So, it really is old friends, new friends and a whole lotta love.\\u201d Again presented by Blue Chair Bay\\u00ae Rum, the Sun Goes Down 2024 Tour brings all the high velocity energy and songs people know by heart back to America\\u2019s favorite stadiums.

Painted in an Afrofuturist style, Townes\\u2019 autobiographical works serve as a rigorous commentary of Black identity, depicting representations that range from being adequately rebellious to thoroughly politically engaged and enraged. Approaching each work through an intuitive art making practice, Townes\\u2019 process of layering vibrant colors, glitter, and resin, is meant to mirror the complex nature of Black women's oneness in challenging spaces while investigating the experience of intersectional feminism. By painting directly onto raw wood surfaces, she references the aesthetics and graphic style of street art culture, conveying the sense of its power by figuratively and literally taking up space. By exposing the beauty in raw, and sometimes distressed materials, she calls attention to the act of physical construction and the social construction of unapologetic Black women represented in these works. Artist biography: Kamara Townes, known professionally as Wavy Wednesday, is an artist, muralist and activist based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her work highlights the more playful aspects of her experiences as a Black feminist artist and incorporates elements of pop culture, street art, and Afrofuturism to confront and comment on social, racial, and gender justice. Her multidisciplinary practice, which encompasses painting, sculpture, murals, and installations have been celebrated and featured in several public art projects in the city of Pittsburgh, published in Brian Burley\\u2019s \\u201cYNGBLKPGH,\\u201d and shared widely on popular social media sites including Afropunk and Supermarket Magazine. Townes received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from California University of Pennsylvania and is currently pursuing a Master of Fine Arts degree with a focus in painting at West Virginia University.

Together with you, The Better Block Foundation, Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, and the Richard King Mellon Foundation are collaboratively working to re-envision part of the parking lot (aka The Backyard) for a summer series. This community-led placemaking event aims to inspire residents to creatively transform the parking lot via activation throughout the summer to imagine what it could be in the future. Anticipated enhancements include seating, art installations, and new opportunities for community gatherings. Throughout the summer, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust will partner with local organizations to keep the fun flowing. PUMP's Pittsburgh Sports League (PSL) will serve up the fun as they welcome players onto two new pickleball courts. Discover a night market where style, music, and flavors collide! The Pittsburgh Downtown Neighbors Alliance (DNA) welcomes you to immerse yourself in fashion-forward boutiques while listening to local live music, and enjoying delectable bites from our array of food trucks. The objective of the summer-long activation is to experiment with ideas, gather feedback, and integrate community input to help shape a more vibrant and inviting space long-term in the Giant Eagle Foundation Backyard and adjacent Penn Avenue and 8th Street parcels. This summer marks the third consecutive year the space will welcome the public. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, Better Block Foundation, RK Mellon Foundation, and participating partners have a collective goal of creating a dynamic environment where residents can live, work, and come together as a thriving community.\"\n",

While the case ended legal school segregation and declared separate educational facilities to be inherently unequal, the court did not guide the implementation of Brown v. Broad and left its enforcement to school districts. Ten years later, in 1964, the Civil Rights Act was signed, prohibiting discrimination in public places and employment. Civil Rights assisted in forcing the issue of removing discrimination, yet it did not provide a clear framework for school implementation for students or increasing minority hiring practices in the classroom. The execution of the ruling was met with resistance nationwide and led to challenges that continue to affect schools seventy years later. During this commemorative program, educators will discuss issues that stemmed from the decision and share resources and information on how to advocate for public education today. Current high school students and recent graduates will then present on a variety of topics affecting education to give attendees a sense of how the landmark decision has impacted schools for the last 70 years.

This documentary uses previously unseen archive to examine Capra\\u2019s story and unpick his complex relationship with America. We hear in his own words how he fought to escape his Italian American roots and eventually made his way to Hollywood in the early years of the studio system. The film offers a candid portrait of a complicated man whose stories of hope in troubled times continue to speak to audiences today. Despite his humble beginnings, by the 1930s Frank Capra was perhaps the most successful and influential film director in the world. Today we still use the term Capra-esque to describe his particular kind of storytelling. But more than that, Capra\\u2019s films spoke to a public that was wearied by world events. The Great Depression was devastating lives, World War II was around the corner, and Capra\\u2019s movies were seen by many as a balm in troubled times. His films brought audiences together and offered a vision of America where ideals win out, decency triumphs and ordinary people have their day.

Come downtown for our whiskey history tour where you will discover how whiskey has fueled political, labor and social movements throughout the region. We start the tour with a sample of the oldest and longest continuously produced whiskey in America. A second taster of locally produced whiskey will get you into the mood to explore Pittsburgh's whiskey past and present. As we walk the streets of Downtown, you'll learn about the violent Whiskey Rebellion in Pittsburgh, hidden former (as well as existing!) speakeasies around the city, and how Prohibition affected the region. Besides that you will find out a lot about the revival of craft spirits, the history of a local and family-owned distillery and the first privately run liquor store in PA since before Prohibition. You will get 2 generous whiskey samples (endless refills!) at the beginning of the tour and 1 handcrafted cocktail at the Rebel Room, where you can hang out and grab dinner after the tour. ***Please note: This is NOT a bar crawl but a whiskey history tour that includes whiskey samples and one handcrafted cocktail.

The new 4K restoration of THE SMALL BACK ROOM is a collaboration of Martin Scorsese\\u2019s The Film Foundation and the BFI National Archive, in association with Studiocanal. Mr. Scorsese and his longtime film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who was married to Michael Powell from 1984 until his death in 1990, served as consultants on the restoration.

Previous kayak experience is required. Please arrive early to allow time to find parking and bring a flashlight or headlamp. The start of the fireworks may be delayed if the baseball game runs late. While the event is scheduled to conclude at 10:30 PM guides will remain on the water if participants wish to see the show. To best accommodate all parties, participants also have the option to depart at 10:30 PM. Trip Leader: Our trained Excursionists and Volunteer Trip Leaders all have night paddling experience. They will guide the group along the river before the show. Once a good spot is found, the group will remain there to take in the fireworks! Activity level: Intermediate \\u2013 We recommend participants have some paddling experience in the past. This does not need to be extensive, not does it need to have occurred during the nighttime. However, nighttime paddling has more variables so the previous experience will come in handy! What to Bring: While kayaking is not necessarily a \\u201cget wet\\u201d sport, you might get dripped on or splashed occasionally. It is best to wear clothes that dry quickly. Wear comfortable shoes that could potentially get wet . Additionally, since we will be paddling at night, a light jacket might come in handy. Venture Outdoors will provide all the necessary kayak lights for nighttime operations. Distance: Participants should not expect to cover a long distance for this trip \\u2013 likely between 0.5 and 1.0 miles overall. We will depart from the launch, do some light paddling around the Point area (unable to cross the river to the Point due to the fireworks safety zone), and then remain on the water for the show. Starting Location: The trip will depart from our launch at Heinz Quay on the riverwalk directly below Acrisure Stadium. The google maps link is below. https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jnsjfnye2rD3MuEx7 Ticket Sales Close: Ticket sales will close 24 hours before the event time. Other Information: Please arrive 15 minutes before the start time to ensure that the trip gets underway on time. Please be mindful of traffic and road closures that may occur due to the Pirates game. Parking may take longer than usual as well. We recommend parking at either the Champions Garage or the Red 5 Garage on West General Robinson Street. Dress for the weather (Venture Outdoors trips proceed rain or shine!), bring water and wear comfortable closed toe shoes. By purchasing a ticket, you acknowledge that you are physically able to undertake the activity described above.\"\n",

Wear comfortable shoes that could potentially get wet . Anything you take on the water with you can get wet! Distance: We\\u2019ll cover roughly 1.0-1.5 miles round trip. Expect to spend about 1.5 hours or so on the water. Starting Location: The trip will depart from our launch at Heinz Quay on the riverwalk directly below Acrisure Stadium.

This deep dive into the work of the legendary filmmaking duo suggests there would be no Scorsese without them. Powell and Pressburger produced some of the most revered works in the history of cinema, creating \\u201csubversive commercial movies\\u201d that reflect a disillusioned, post\\u2013World War II Western world back to itself. Scorsese is erudite and impassioned as he lovingly charts Powell and Pressburger\\u2019s working relationship, personal histories, and their collective artistic voice, referencing classics like The Red Shoes and Black Narcissus , and drawing direct lines to scenes, colours and creative decisions in his own work. Drawing on an astonishing array of archival materials, references, and the Powell and Pressburger oeuvre, Made in England illuminates the enduring power of their unique brand of cinema in a way only Scorsese can.

            "        \"more_details\": \"Demi Moore satirises Hollywood ageism in this audacious and gory feminist body horror that was the talk of this year\\u2019s Cannes Film Festival. Elisabeth Sparkle is a faded fiftysomething star who\\u2019s just been fired from her TV workout show by a sleazy executive. Then she learns about \\u2018The Substance\\u2019: a mysterious injection that \\u201cunlocks your DNA\\u201d, birthing a young, gorgeous version of yourself from your own spine. Of course, there\\u2019s a catch: every seven days, one body heads out into the world while the other enters recuperative stasis. So when Elisabeth\\u2019s ambitious younger self refuses to surrender her newfound fame, the elder begins paying the price\\u2026 with a gruesome physical disintegration. In a daringly deranged lead performance, Moore leans in to Elisabeth\\u2019s professional self-loathing with zeal. And as her rebellious clone, Margaret Qualley ( Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ) matches the mayhem at every turn, while the cast that includes Dennis Quaid revels in going ham with the film\\u2019s outrageous premise. French director Coralie Fargeat ( Revenge ) ruthlessly marshals Cronenbergian tropes, from 1980s-inspired production design to some truly superlative prosthetics, provocatively depicting the turmoil of ageing as a woman in a patriarchal world: the horror that part of oneself may be gone forever. Directed by Coralie Fargeat 2024 | USA, United Kingdom, France | English language | DCP Rated R\"\n",

Ani DiFranco crashed onto the music scene in the early \\u201890s, a thundering new voice in the cultural wilderness, unapologetically bisexual, political and feminist. She toured relentlessly, thrashing out hundreds of frenzied shows that were part mosh pit, part hootenanny and part full-on tent revival, then selling cassette tapes from the trunk of her car to make it to the next gig. Ani became a worldwide phenomenon when she beat the male-dominated music industry at its own game by founding Righteous Babe Records, the first \\u201cwoman-run non-corporate queer-happy\\u201d label, still going strong after nearly 35 years. The press called her \\u201can entrepreneurial wonder\\u201d and \\u201cthe industry\\u2019s worst nightmare.\\u201d Prince called her \\u201cmy hero.\\u201d Ani simply called herself a folk singer, dedicated to art, activism and staying true to herself, no matter the cost. 1-800-ON-HER-OWN takes us on a wild cinematic road trip, from DiFranco\\u2019s punk-folk past to her life today as she reinvents herself as a passionate activist and revered rock star. Throughout the ride, she\\u2019s brutally honest, famously foul-mouthed and totally hilarious. Her daily challenges resonate as we reveal both an enduring, inspiring musical icon and a very relatable contemporary \\u201ceverywoman\\u201d with her own epic fails and hard-won victories.

Previous kayak experience is required. Please arrive early to allow time to find parking and bring a flashlight or headlamp. The start of the fireworks may be delayed if the baseball game runs late. While the event is scheduled to conclude at 10:30 PM guides will remain on the water if participants wish to see the show. To best accommodate all parties, participants also have the option to depart at 10:30 PM. Trip Leader: Our trained Excursionists and Volunteer Trip Leaders all have night paddling experience. They will guide the group along the river before the show. Once a good spot is found, the group will remain there to take in the fireworks! Activity level: Intermediate \\u2013 We recommend participants have some paddling experience in the past. This does not need to be extensive, not does it need to have occurred during the nighttime. However, nighttime paddling has more variables so the previous experience will come in handy! What to Bring: While kayaking is not necessarily a \\u201cget wet\\u201d sport, you might get dripped on or splashed occasionally. It is best to wear clothes that dry quickly. Wear comfortable shoes that could potentially get wet . Additionally, since we will be paddling at night, a light jacket might come in handy. Venture Outdoors will provide all the necessary kayak lights for nighttime operations. Distance: Participants should not expect to cover a long distance for this trip \\u2013 likely between 0.5 and 1.0 miles overall. We will depart from the launch, do some light paddling around the Point area (unable to cross the river to the Point due to the fireworks safety zone), and then remain on the water for the show. Starting Location: The trip will depart from our launch at Heinz Quay on the riverwalk directly below Acrisure Stadium. The google maps link is below. https://maps.app.goo.gl/Jnsjfnye2rD3MuEx7 Ticket Sales Close: Ticket sales will close 24 hours before the event time. Other Information: Please arrive 15 minutes before the start time to ensure that the trip gets underway on time. Please be mindful of traffic and road closures that may occur due to the Pirates game. Parking may take longer than usual as well. We recommend parking at either the Champions Garage or the Red 5 Garage on West General Robinson Street. Dress for the weather (Venture Outdoors trips proceed rain or shine!), bring water and wear comfortable closed toe shoes. By purchasing a ticket, you acknowledge that you are physically able to undertake the activity described above.\"\n",

The film follows the mysterious, nearly mute drifter Travis (a magnificent Harry Dean Stanton, whose face is a landscape all its own) as he tries to reconnect with his young son, living with his brother (Dean Stockwell) in Los Angeles, and his missing wife (Nastassja Kinski). From this simple setup, Wenders and Shepard produce a powerful statement on codes of masculinity and the myth of the American family, as well as an exquisite visual exploration of a vast, crumbling world of canyons and neon. This beautiful new restoration also highlights the incredible cinematography by Robby M\\u00c3\\u00bcller, whose use of natural light and minimilast landscapes are an integral part of the film's lasting legacy.

Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts \\u201cThe Rainbow Club,\\u201d Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated.  Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross\\u2019 simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of \\u201cno mistakes, only happy accidents\\u201d further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond\\u2019s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.\"\n",

Let\\u2019s find out\\u2026 There are many rooms in the house of mystery. There are rooms for perfect mysteries, powerful mysteries, comedic mysteries, and meaningful mysteries. Henok specializes in offering personalized mysteries; he is not looking for perfection but rather to forge a relationship and an understanding within the world of the incomprehensible. While most of us do our best to manage the outcomes of our lives, there are many instances which are beyond our control. Unplanned chance encounters, events that cannot be predicted. In his show, Meant to Be , Henok will take you on a journey highlighting those instances which cannot be explained and leave you with the feeling of magic. Illusions that explore themes of dating, marriage, trust, journaling, and experiences with universal relatability will be explored in Henok\\u2019s deeply personal and interactive magic show. While on stage, Henok is a magician, mentalist, humorist, but most importantly he is an entertainer. Henok took up magic at the tender age of 12. Since then, he has performed in 5 countries spanning from France to Thailand, entertaining corporations, private parties, and nightclubs including The Hollywood Magic Castle. What makes Henok unique is how he seamlessly adapts to whatever environment he is placed in. Simply put, Henok understands how to communicate and relate to people.\"\n",

Whether soldier or civilian, military service has always required from women a complicated balancing act, managing the needs of home, family, work, and service, while supporting a loved one away on duty, or increasingly in the modern era, taking on that role themselves.\"\n",

The venue is surrounded by Cadillacs, motorcycles, rock bars, and the awe-inspiring beauty of nature, encapsulating the very essence of cinema\\u2019s enchantment \\u2013 a place where the magic resides in its profound capacity to instigate change. In chronicling the creation of Kino Laika, Croatian-French filmmaker Veljko Vidak has created a modest yet finely-crafted film that is simultaneously a documentary about a particular cultural project, a more wide-ranging filmic meditation on the nature of cinema, and a portrait of a small-town community. Transcending the usual documentary trappings, CINEMA LAIKA radiates a deadpan charm and bemused curiosity about humanity that calls to mind nothing so much as the work of Kaurism\\u00e4ki himself. About Ariel: In Kaurism\\u00e4ki\\u2019s drolly existential crime drama, a coal miner named Taisto attempts to leave behind a provincial life of inertia and economic despair, only to get into ever deeper trouble. Yet a minor-key romance with a hilariously dispassionate meter maid might provide a light at the end of a very dark tunnel. ARIEL, which boasts a terrific soundtrack of Finnish tango and Baltic pop music and lovely cinematography by Kaurism\\u00e4ki\\u2019s longtime cameraman Timo Salmimen, put its director on the international map. Directed by Veljko Vidak 2023 | France, Finland | Finnish, French, and English language with English subtitles | DCP\"\n",

Daytime Revolution takes us back in time to the week that John Lennon and Yoko Ono descended upon a Philadelphia broadcasting studio to co-host the iconic Mike Douglas Show, at the time the most popular show on daytime television with an audience of 40 million viewers a week. What followed was five unforgettable episodes of television, with Lennon and Ono at the helm and Douglas bravely keeping the show on track. Acting as both producers and hosts, Lennon and Ono handpicked their guests, including controversial choices like Yippie founder Jerry Rubin and Black Panther Chairman Bobby Seale, as well as political activist Ralph Nader and comic truth teller George Carlin. Their version of daytime TV was a radical take on the traditional format, incorporating candid Q&A sessions with their transfixed audience, conversations about current issues like police violence and women\\u2019s liberation, conceptual art events, and one-of-a-kind musical performances, including a unique duet with Lennon and Chuck Berry and a poignant rendition of Lennon\\u2019s \\u201cImagine\\u201d.

This special screening includes two classics directed by and starring Buster Keaton, and both with live accompaniment! First up is SHERLOCK JR (1924) with a live piano score by Tom Roberts: Keaton\\u2019s classic about a lovestruck projectionist who falls asleep during a show and dreams he has entered the film as a detective is a delightful and ingenious comedy. Sherlock Jr. is a high point of silent cinema, featuring one of Keaton\\u2019s cleverest conceits, and doubling as a reflection on cinema itself. About Tom Roberts: Tom Roberts is one of the leading scholars of early jazz piano in the world today (as stated by Ricardo Sciavales in The Heart and Soul of Stride, Blues, and Swing Piano). He has performed on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, The Statler Brothers Show on TNN, and A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor. Tom was pianist for Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks in New York City and pianist and musical director for Leon Redbone for six years. Tom has recorded over 40 compact discs and has performed throughout the United States and Europe. And then our second film, THE NAVIGATOR (1924), with a live score by The Pittsburgh Film Orchestra: In this revered silent comedy, the wealthy and impulsive Rollo Treadway (Buster Keaton) decides to propose to his beautiful socialite neighbor, Betsy O'Brien (Kathryn McGuire). Alhough Betsy turns Rollo down, he still opts to go on the cruise that he intended as their honeymoon. When circumstances find both Rollo and Betsy on the wrong ship, they end up having adventures on the high seas, allowing Keaton plenty of opportunities to display his trademark agility. About the Pittsburgh Film Orchestra: The Pittsburgh Film Orchestra began life in 2007 as the Ivy Leaf Orchestra, an ensemble formed to provide live musical accompaniment for silent films. Our first performance was for the 1917 Douglas Fairbanks feature, A Modern Musketeer. Since then the Pittsburgh Film Orchestra has provided music for a wide variety of classic comedies and dramatic films. The ensemble utilizes music published between 1885 and 1930, including hundreds of compositions specifically written for theatre orchestras and movie accompaniment. We call ourselves an orchestra even though by modern standards we\\u2019re really a chamber ensemble because that was the tradition in the silent era; as long as you had at least two instrumentalists, you had an orchestra! The PFO is a flexible ensemble (ranging from 2 to 22 players), and the ensemble emulates the best aspects of film accompaniment from the silent era to provide an emotionally and aesthetically satisfying viewing experience.

Then she learns about \\u2018The Substance\\u2019: a mysterious injection that \\u201cunlocks your DNA\\u201d, birthing a young, gorgeous version of yourself from your own spine. Of course, there\\u2019s a catch: every seven days, one body heads out into the world while the other enters recuperative stasis. So when Elisabeth\\u2019s ambitious younger self refuses to surrender her newfound fame, the elder begins paying the price\\u2026 with a gruesome physical disintegration. In a daringly deranged lead performance, Moore leans in to Elisabeth\\u2019s professional self-loathing with zeal.

French director Coralie Fargeat ( Revenge ) ruthlessly marshals Cronenbergian tropes, from 1980s-inspired production design to some truly superlative prosthetics, provocatively depicting the turmoil of ageing as a woman in a patriarchal world: the horror that part of oneself may be gone forever.

Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts \\u201cThe Rainbow Club,\\u201d Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated.  Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross\\u2019 simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of \\u201cno mistakes, only happy accidents\\u201d further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond\\u2019s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.\"\n",

New York, 1944\\u20131985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films\\u2014all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York\\u2019s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol\\u2019s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum\\u2019s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby\\u2019s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L\\u2019Amico Fried\\u2019s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby\\u2019s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.\"\n",

Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts \\u201cThe Rainbow Club,\\u201d Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated.  Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross\\u2019 simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of \\u201cno mistakes, only happy accidents\\u201d further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment.

New York, 1944\\u20131985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films\\u2014all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York\\u2019s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol\\u2019s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum\\u2019s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby\\u2019s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L\\u2019Amico Fried\\u2019s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby\\u2019s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.\"\n",

Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts \\u201cThe Rainbow Club,\\u201d Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated.  Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross\\u2019 simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of \\u201cno mistakes, only happy accidents\\u201d further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond\\u2019s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work.

New York, 1944\\u20131985), a pivotal figure bridging the pre- and post-liberation eras of gay experimental filmmaking. This exhibition is the inaugural project in a series of exhibitions and programs dedicated to historic artists who have created significant work in, about, or influenced by the city of Pittsburgh, specifically in the field of time-based or experimental media. Roger Jacoby's career as a filmmaker spanned from 1972 until his untimely death from AIDS in 1985, during which he completed eight films\\u2014all produced in Pittsburgh. Originally trained as a painter and classical pianist, Jacoby's artistic journey took a transformative turn through his work as a gallery assistant for his aunt, Rose Fried. This role introduced him to New York\\u2019s vibrant artistic circles, including Andy Warhol\\u2019s Factory, where he met his long-time partner, the Warhol Superstar Ondine. Encouraged by filmmaker Marie Menken, who gifted him his first film camera, Jacoby began experimenting with film around 1970. Seeking a change in environment, he and Ondine relocated to Pittsburgh in 1972, where Jacoby found a job playing piano for silent films at the Carnegie Museum of Art. There, he connected with Sally Dixon, the museum\\u2019s pioneering Film Department founder, who introduced him to the Pittsburgh Filmmakers, then based at the Selma Burke Art Center, a key gathering place for local artists. Jacoby\\u2019s approach to filmmaking was both practical and deeply personal. He began processing his film footage in his own bathroom, using his bathtub as a makeshift darkroom. Even after receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant in 1972 to acquire more advanced equipment, Jacoby continued hand-processing his films, embracing the unique, handcrafted qualities that became the hallmark of his work. Over the past three years, The Berkely Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive have meticulously transferred and restored a selection of Jacoby's early films, with support from the Avant-Garde Masters Grants awarded by The Film Foundation and the National Film Preservation Foundation. On view at Wood Street Galleries from October 2024 through January 2025 are Dream Sphinx Opera (1973) and L\\u2019Amico Fried\\u2019s Glamorous Friends (1976), which showcase Jacoby's innovative use of hand-processing techniques to manipulate film emulsion, resulting in striking abstract imagery. These films feature appearances by Sally Dixon and Ondine, along with other members of Pittsburgh's art and film communities, set against backdrops that include Phipps Conservatory, Carnegie Music Hall, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and various domestic spaces, including Jacoby\\u2019s own apartment on Walnut Street in Shadyside. Also on view will be How to Be a Homosexual Part I (1980), in which Jacoby turns his camera on his own community. This film captures intimate portraits of his sister and mother, a deaf friend, and a gay couple from the Gay Activist Alliance, revealing the personal and communal aspects of Jacoby's work. These films, marked by Jacoby's characteristic blending of avant-garde techniques and personal narrative, offer a compelling window into the life and artistic vision of a filmmaker whose work remains a vital part of Pittsburgh's cultural legacy.\"\n",

Bond's oeuvre is characterized by the integration of extraterrestrial imagery, including aliens, spacecraft, and Sasquatch, into natural environments such as the Colorado Mountains, Niagara Falls, Lake Erie, and Mt. St. Helena. These entities, with whom Bond professes communication, are depicted in tranquil landscapes, symbolizing hope and moral integrity. Another series depicts \\u201cThe Rainbow Club,\\u201d Bond's vision for a utopian social venue that welcomes all beings, transcending barriers of gender, ability, age, and even species. In a fragmented society, Bond's work envisions a harmonious realm where diversity is not only accepted but celebrated.  Bond initially honed her artistic skills and developed her unique aesthetic language through exposure to The Joy of Painting, a groundbreaking instructional television program created by Bob Ross that aired from 1983 to 1994 on PBS. The Joy of Painting democratized access to arts education, including individuals with disabilities. Airing on public television, the show allowed people to learn how to paint from their homes, eliminating both cost barriers and the need for physical attendance in classes. Ross\\u2019 simple, encouraging instruction and adaptive tools and techniques made painting approachable for everyone, regardless of skill level or physical ability. The flexible viewing format and his philosophy of \\u201cno mistakes, only happy accidents\\u201d further promoted creativity and individual expression, breaking down barriers and highlighting the inclusive power of art. Since 2018, Bond has been a resident artist at VaultArt Studio, a progressive arts organization that supports and promotes the inclusion of artists with disabilities in contemporary art by providing professional-level arts instruction in a supportive studio environment. Bond\\u2019s affiliation with VaultArt Studio has allowed her to further develop and professionalize her artistic practice, engage with a diverse community of artists, and continue to advocate for inclusivity through her work. Her contributions to the studio and the broader community exemplify her commitment to creating a world where differences are embraced and celebrated.\"\n",
