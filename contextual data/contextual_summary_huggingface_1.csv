"{'title': 'Rockies Select Luis Peralta ', 'content': 'Per MLBTR:\n\n""The Rockies announced that they have selected the contract of left-hander Luis Peralta. In corresponding moves, they optioned right-hander Tanner Gordon to Triple-A Albuquerque and transferred righty Germán Márquez to the 60-day injured list.\n\nPeralta, 23, was just acquired from the Pirates last month in the Jalen Beeks trade. The younger brother of Brewers ace Freddy Peralta, Luis signed with the Pirates out of the Dominican Republic in 2017. He came up as a starter but has been moved into a relief role this year, with some encouraging results.\n\nHe has pitched at High-A, Double-A and Triple-A this year between his two organizations. Between all those different stops, he has logged 47 2/3 innings while only allowing five earned runs for a tiny ERA of 0.94. His 11.2% walk rate in that time is a bit high but he’s worked around that by striking out 40.1% of batters that have stepped to the plate.\n\nHe was going to be eligible for the Rule 5 draft this winter and was likely going to get a roster spot in a few months’ time anyway, so the Rockies are jumping the gun and adding him now, which will allow them to get a look at him against major league hitters for a few weeks.\n\nGordon had been working out of the club’s rotation, so they will now have a hole there behind Cal Quantrill, Kyle Freeland, Austin Gomber and Bradley Blalock. Right-hander Ryan Feltner landed on the 15-day IL on August 8 due to a right shoulder strain but could perhaps be coming back. Patrick Lyons of Just Baseball relayed on X last week that Feltner’s MRI came back clean and he could be back after something close to a minimal stint. He made a rehab appearance for Triple-A Albuquerque on Wednesday.\n\nAs for Marquez, it was reported a couple of weeks ago that he won’t be coming back this year due to some elbow inflammation, so this transfer to the 60-day IL was an inevitable formality. He’ll be on the 60-day IL for the rest of the year but will need to be reinstated in the days following the World Series, as the IL goes away until Spring Training.', 'date': '2024-08-24 12:27:04'}","Rockies select Luis Peralta, optioning Tanner Gordon and transferring Germán Márquez to the 60-day IL."

In those 3 years he's only played 98 games and 410 plate appearances.  \nThis year he has appeared in 113 games and 463 plate appearances.    \nThis will be his first full year basically.  \n\nHe has a 2.3 War but a DWar -.3.  Still a positive player.  Could it be better?  Of course!  But Cruz is young with a payroll hit of $755K.  That's not a bad deal for a Starter level player.\n\nHe's had some bumps and some bad plays but hopefully he learns and grows from the experiences.  If we are talking 2 years from now he's still the same player, then yes I'll criticize him harshly.  But for now enjoy the ride and hope that he continues to improve.\n\nYes, I like Cruz and have been frustrated at times.

Currently the Pirates are 8 games out of the WC and the division looks locked for the Brew Crew. The way things are looking Buccos will be hovering around the same record as last year. I can see Skenes being shutdown soon and young prospects getting a chance to gain some experience.\n\nHeading into the off season, what do you think the play will be from the front office? Here are a few questions:\n\n* Will GMBC still be here? What goals is he setting for next year? I think specific goals other than ""be competitive"" need to be set.\n* Will Shelton still be with the team? This includes hitting and pitching coaches as well. I know this subreddit has issues with Haines.\n* Will Cutch sign one more year? Honestly, I do not see him as a starting DH in the league anymore.\n* There is depth for the starting rotation including a few in the minor pipeline. Will we make some trades to bolster the offense?\n* How can the Pirates address the issues with underperforming prospects such as Suwinski and Davis?\n* How can the DH / 1B position be maximized next year? \n\nThis sub has great baseball insight, however, sometimes they never delve into specifics moving forward. I feel like the fans deserve to get more transparency from the front office into this rebuild with tangible goals such as:\n\n* We plan to get a wild card spot.\n* We plan to win at least 80 games.\n* We plan to sign a bat with an OPS above 800.\n\nMaybe I am naive on this front, however, after this season there are more questions than answers. This ""window"" that everyone has talked about is here and if they do not have answers and clear cut objectives, I don\'t see them going anywhere in the next few years.', 'date': '2024-08-20 13:57:13'}",The document discusses expectations for the Pirates' performance in the final month of the season and potential changes in the front office's strategy for the upcoming offseason.
"{'title': 'Real team owner ', 'content': '“This is why it’s important to go out and sign people like Bryce Harper, why you pay Zack Wheeler $40-plus million a year for three years,” Middleton said. “It’s because this is how the fans react. It’s important to them. They appreciate it. They recognize it. I love that. I have other owners who look at me and say, ‘We don’t get this.’ … It’s remarkable how special this city is as a fan base.\n\n“It’s why I keep telling everybody, it may be a privately-held business that we own, but it’s not a private organization. It’s a very public organization. It’s a stewardship. We have an obligation. We are accountable to the fans and to the city. If you don’t approach it that way, you shouldn’t be an owner in my opinion.”\n\nWish Bob Nitting was more like the Phillies owner!', 'date': '2024-08-19 18:50:45'}",Middleton emphasizes the importance of being a steward of the team's success and accountability to fans and the city.

"{'title': 'Make Joey Bart our 2025 starting 1B', 'content': 'I heard that Endy was being practiced at 1B for next year, and i think that’s a massive mistake. The Pirates should not move Endy Rodriguez to 1B: they should move Joey Bart. \n\nJoey Bart has a higher wRC+ this year than Pete Alonso, Freddie Freeman, and Matt Olson, while being only a little under Bryce Harper and well under Vlad Guerrero Jr\n\nThose are some of the best 1Bs in the league\n\nby wRC+, Joey Bart would be the *third best hitting 1B in the league* if he were a 1B. The catcher to 1B pipeline is strong (hell, Yaz does it, Endy’s doing it, Joe Mauer, Carlos Santana from started as a catcher and now plays gold glove 1B defense). \n\nWe have no depth at 1B and a glut at catcher: this feels like a no-brainer. Bart (and Davis) grade out very poorly at catcher; the only thing Bart is above average at is caught stealings, and even there he’s in the 57th percentile, so *barely* above average. Endy for reference was twice as good at blocking (though still bad), miles better at CS and pop time, and still better than Bart at framing. In other words, according to Baseball Savant’s metrics, Endy is better at every single metric than Bart defensively, and in two cases, significantly better. \n\nBart’s numbers may decline as he learns a new position, but it’s worth noting that it is a far, far easier position to learn than catcher. Once he gets it down and can devote even more time to BP, i expect him to crush the ball — and, in a pinch, we would have a third catcher on the roster which gives us additional defensive flexibility.', 'date': '2024-08-17 21:06:09'}",The document argues that Joey Bart should replace Endy Rodriguez at 1B for the Pirates in 2025.
