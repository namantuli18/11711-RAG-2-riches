Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw.The Immaculate ReceptionThe Immaculate ReceptionPittsburgh SteelersPittsburgh Steelers, American professional gridiron footballteam based in Pittsburgh that plays in the NFL. One of the league’s most successful and storied franchises, theSteelers have won six Super Bowl titles and eight American Football Conference (AFC) championships.Originally called the Pittsburgh Pirates, the team was founded in 1933 by Pittsburgh resident Art Rooney, whoallegedly used winnings from a wager on a horse race to establish the franchise. (Ownership of the team remainswithin the Rooney family to this day.) The team was not an early success; it qualiﬁed for the playoffs just once inits ﬁrst 37 years. In 1940 the team changed its nickname to “Steelers” in tribute to Pittsburgh’s main industry atthe time. The Steelers tied for the NFL Eastern Division title in 1947, but they were shut out 21–0 by thePhiladelphia Eagles in a playoff match to qualify for the NFL championship game. Rooney watched the Steelersstruggle through the 1950s and ’60s until their fortunes turned around with the arrival of head coach Chuck Nollin 1969.From 1969 to 1972 Noll showcased his amazing skill atrecognizing talent as he drafted ﬁve future Hall of Famers:defensive tackle “Mean” Joe Greene, quarterback TerryBradshaw, defensive back Mel Blount, linebacker Jack Ham,and running back Franco Harris (remembered for his“Immaculate Reception,” a game-winning catch in theplayoffs against the Oakland Raiders in 1972, one of themost remarkable and controversial plays in professionalfootball history). In 1974 Noll selected four more players who would eventually be inducted into the Hall ofFame: center Mike Webster, receivers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth, and linebacker Jack Lambert. Theseplayers went on to form a dynasty of unmatched success, winning four Super Bowls (1975, 1976, 1979, and1980) in six seasons behind a dominant defense known as the “Steel Curtain” and an efﬁcient offense led byBradshaw. The Steelers teams of the 1970s were also characterized by a fervent fan base, notable for the brightyellow “Terrible Towels”—which were created by the team’s popular and idiosyncratic radio broadcaster for 35years, Myron Cope—that fans would wave during home games. Pittsburgh faded slightly in the 1980s, with fourpostseason berths in the decade, and Noll retired in 1991.Noll was replaced by Bill Cowher, who led the Steelers to the playoffs in 10 of his 15 seasons with the team. Oneof Cowher’s most signiﬁcant personnel moves was his promotion of secondary coach Dick LeBeau to the positionof defensive coordinator in 1995: in his two stints (1995–97, 2004–15) as the Steelers’ coordinator, LeBeau puttogether formidable defenses that deﬁned the Pittsburgh teams of those eras. The Steelers’ defense of the mid-1990s was highlighted by stars such as future Hall of Fame cornerback Rod Woodson and linebackers Greg Lloydand Kevin Greene. Pittsburgh advanced to the Super Bowl in 1996 but lost to the Dallas Cowboys.

In 2009 theSteelers, under the leadership of second-year head coach MikeTomlin, beat the Arizona Cardinals in dramatic fashion to capturetheir record sixth Super Bowl championship. After missing theplayoffs following the 2009 regular season, Pittsburgh captured itsthird AFC championship in a six-year span in 2011 to earn a berth inSuper Bowl XLV, a loss to the Green Bay Packers.The Steelers returned to the playoffs after both the 2011 and 2014 regular seasons, but the team lost in theopening round of each postseason. Pittsburgh won its ﬁrst playoff game following the 2015 season but waseliminated by the Denver Broncos in the divisional round. The team won 11 games the following year andadvanced to the playoffs, where the Steelers lost to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in the AFCchampionship game for the third time. Pittsburgh topped that regular-season performance in 2017 with 13 wins,which tied with three other teams for the most in the NFL. However, the Steelers were upset in the team’s openingplayoff game. In 2018 the team went 9–6–1 while enduring a number of high-proﬁle public spats among many ofits best players, missing the postseason for the ﬁrst time in ﬁve years.From 2019 to 2023 the Steelers continued their reliably solid, if unspectacular, play under the steady leadership ofTomlin, who, since he joined the team in 2007, has never ﬁnished a season with fewer than eight wins. A strongdefense was a hallmark of the team, led by linebacker T.J. Watt, a perennial Defensive Player of the Year ﬁnalist(he won the award in 2021). Pittsburgh made the playoffs after the 2020, 2021, and 2023 seasons, each timelosing in the wild card round.Adam Augustyn
