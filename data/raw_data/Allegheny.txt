AlleghenyAllegheny, county, southwestern Pennsylvania, U.S., consisting of a hilly region on the Allegheny Plateaubounded to the southeast by the Monongahela and Youghiogheny rivers and to the northeast by the AlleghenyRiver. The Ohio, Allegheny, and Monongahela rivers converge in the centre of the county to form an area knownas the Golden Triangle; this was a strategic point of contention between the French and the English, who fortiﬁedthe area with Fort Duquesne (1754) and Fort Pitt (1761), respectively. With the defeat of Pontiac’s warriors(1763), the area opened up to settlers who founded Pittsburgh (1764), which became the county seat whenAllegheny county was formed in 1788. The county’s name is derived from the Delaware Indian word oolikhanna,meaning “good river.” The Triangle is now Pittsburgh’s central business district and the location of the popularPoint State Park.Pittsburgh, which was linked to outside markets by the Pennsylvania Canal and the Portage Railroad (bothcompleted in 1834), became the nation’s centre for the iron, steel, and glass industries in the 19th century.
