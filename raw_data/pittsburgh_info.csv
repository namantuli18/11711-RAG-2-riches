History,"Pittsburgh was founded on November 27, 1758. The city was named by General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, the 1st Earl of Chatham. Early on, Pittsburgh played an important role in our country’s history. In the early 1800s, the city became known as the “Gateway to the West.” This nickname referenced the huge advantage Pittsburgh had by having the intersection of three major waterways. The Allegheny River and Monongahela River join together at what is known as the “point” to form the Ohio River. This intersection opened the gates for Pittsburgh to lead the way in the trade industry for products such as coal, timber, glass, natural gas, iron and limestone. By 1911, Pittsburgh manufactured half of the nation’s steel. Due to the amount of pollution given off by the steel factories the city had a new nickname - “The Smoky City.""
Throughout the years, Pittsburgh has made multiple changes and overcome many obstacles. The city has moved from the steel industry to become a leader in healthcare, education, technology, and financial services. What were once heavily polluted streets and riverfronts, have been transformed to create the modern vibrant Pittsburgh one sees today."
Population Statistics,"The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is the sixth largest populated state in the United States. Pittsburgh is the second largest city in Pennsylvania and has an estimated of 310,000 people. The population consists of 51.9% females and 48.9% males, with the average age being 33. Pittsburgh, serves as the County Seat of Allegheny County which has an estimated population of 1.2 million.

Pittsburgh is known for having more named neighborhoods than any American city.

The neighborhoods known as Shadyside, Beechview, or the West End are other fantastic region of Pittsburgh to find trendy shops and restaurants. If you’re looking for authentic homemade Italian food, Bloomfield or “Pittsburgh’s Little Italy” is the place for you.

The blue sign system was created and is still in effect today. Another lasting legacy was her fiscal responsibility. Pittsburgh would privatize numerous costly assets such as the Pittsburgh Zoo, the National Aviary, Phipps Conservatory, and the Schenley Park Golf Course.
Perhaps her most famous action Masloff became the first Pittsburgh official to suggest the Pittsburgh Pirates be given their own baseball stadium outside of Three Rivers Stadium. Then criticized for her “Clemente Field” it would go on to be the inspiration for PNC Park and Heinz Field.
