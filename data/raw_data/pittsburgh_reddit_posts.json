We probably only waited in line for 15 minutes, though, early in the afternoon.  \nTook about seven minutes for passengers to discharge and refill, a 2-1/2 minute ride, and then about another seven minutes to offload everyone again. I would've liked to go around more than twice because it was such an unusual experience! The carnival games consisted of axe throwing, pick-a-duck out of a tub of water, ring-over-bottle toss, high-striker game‚Ä¶ The only food stand sold pretzels ($12) and bags of popcorn plus beverages. All in all, it was fun for about 25 minutes and then it was over.\n\nThe Market Square experience consisted of a couple of Primanti's tents selling brat sandwiches, a couple of beer tents, and a streudel tent with a covered eating area in the center.  We missed the live music but German polkas were playing on a loudspeaker.   Ended up at the Original Oyster House for lunch (best choice!).\n\nIt was a beautiful day to be in the city but they really need to try harder next year and add more games, carnival music on the bridge, more food options.",

Local and national-recognized acts performed such as, jazz legends Art Blakey, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, and Kenney Burrell.

We are so close to moving past this phase and finally into production after a year and a half of long nights and hard work, but we just can't seem to figure out how get the printer to produce prints that match the original designs due to all the confusing ink settings and parameters.

(Although it would be great to be a professional Koi farmer.)\n\nPerhaps I have confirmation bias, but it seems that a good deal of my friends only look at their jobs as a temporary fix until the ‚Äúdream job‚Äù comes. \n\nIs it just a false promise, or does it really exist?\n\nPlease, play fair and offer some genuine feedback. I‚Äôll likely share this post to friends and I am looking for some really good input!\n\nAs always, thank you-",

The route for me to get certified in PA wouldn't be too difficult, but my spouse would need to do an alternative accreditation like ABCTE and some Point Park classes. \n\nDo you think any Pittsburgh area or Washington County schools would look favorably at a PhD to teach high school? Would it be a no-go to hire someone still working on obtaining their PA teaching cert? I also teach at a school I love, but that definitely would be considered a tougher school to teach in coming from the Pittsburgh suburbs. I would be happy to teach in a more challenging school. Are there any districts come spring hiring time that would take a chance on educators working on transferring and getting certified, or is this impossible? Thanks for reading my novel!!",

They might not have respect for it but I do and I care that my streets aren't disgusting and filthy.\nIt doesn't seem serious enough to warrant a 911 call unless I witnessed them do it and confronted them with resistance. But I'm also not sure if I should call the police department or something like the environmental healthy and safety department or whatever it's called. I'm also not sure if the culture in those departments would do anything about it.\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

Plus the boyfriend  could walk a blockish to work which means i dont have to worry about his glucose getting  too low to drive home.  But alas cant get in somewhere if they refuse to answer.\n\nMy lease is up end of march. My place in tarentum is essentially  a trap unless someone  puts down and picks up my ramp and i cant use my wheelchair  in most of my place plus they refuse to fix this loud squealing of pipes all year that go off multiple times a day at all hours. They dont allow my heat over 67 and i get irrationally cold to core and cant warm up do to chronic illness so i have to carry a small space heater through house and electric heating pads to get warm (this wasnt disclosed and the rental agency told me to move if i dont like it but will charge to break lease right after we had to hire a moving company cause disabilities). Now i cant get a response a skitchen sink that shoots water over walls and floor if i turn on. And i couldn't  get a wheelchair  till i moved to a first floor place but i cant even use my wheelchair  in most of the apartment  and i am having more trouble walking which means when im alone its hard to get to kitchen and whatnot so boyfriend gets home and has to be my legs most days.\n\nSo i am looking for a 2 bedroom electric wheelchair accessible apartment.

I took the 58 earlier today before I took this photo on the way back to my residence and the roof was leaking, getting water all over the floor and the seating. Feel free to judge me for being a little miffed that the 58 is only accessible every hour, but a lot of people rely on that bus line: students, parents, businessmen, nurses and such. These people rely on the 58 to go to work and school, including myself. The 61C runs every fifteen to thirty minutes due to how many buses are assigned to that line, so why can‚Äôt the 58 be as accessible as the 61C? If the city of Pittsburgh can afford to let UPMC go tax free as a nonprofit, then they can afford to make public transit into downtown accessible, especially since it costs five dollars and five cents for residents in the Homestead, Greenfield, and South Side areas to go into downtown and then come back. If there were more funding in the PRT, there would be more activity in the city and it would genuinely be safer. To add in my conclusion about the whole PRT funding issue, the bus drivers could totally use a raise, point blank period.",

She has been obsessed with Mac Miller for several years and mostly wants to see places that are tributes to him, places he mentions in his songs etc. I'm really not a fan so I'm not familiar with the places she wants to go. I would really like to see the city though as I've never been. We're pretty middle class people so we wouldn't be staying in luxury, but I'm also OK with it costing a few bucks since it's a big deal birthday and trip for her. I'm curious what local people would advise for a few things:\n\n1. The weather - we live in central Texas and don't have much of a winter. I'm picturing muddy snow piled up everywhere and things aren't as lively as usual because everyone is sick of winter. Would it make more sense to wait till March or April? I don't mind being a bit cold, but I'm more wondering if the city feels sort of \"shut down\" at this time of year.\n\n2. Where to stay - we could do a hotel or air bnb. We'd be staying 3 nights, so cost wise either would probably be fine. I'm sure we'd uber to most places, but it would be really cool to stay somewhere that has fun stuff that is walkable. Are there areas we should avoid, like in every city, as far as where to stay?\n\n3. What to do - I would imagine that there is a day or two of Mac Miller stuff to see, but I'd also like to check out some of the other things in the city. I know I can google the big attractions, but I'm just curious what locals think is overhyped or overlooked. She is a vegetarian and I like eating all types of meat. We won't be looking for fine dining or anything, but I'd like to hit up anything that is known to be really good in Pittsburg (regional food). I was looking at flights and we would be coming on a Thursday night and returning on a Sunday. Is there anything in particular that happens every weekend there? Is there a drum circle by any chance somewhere?\n\n  \nThanks in advance for any thoughts!",

I thought maybe Ed Blazina would write something up but he may not have been able to make it. So I'm sharing the questions she asked and what the agency said\n\n* On priority signals\nPeople on the sub have told me that signals were being dropped from the project. So I wanted to hear from the agency directly.\n\nAs of this time signals are being installed downtown for early activation. The signals will be installed and activated on the rest of the route within a few months of the completion of construction.\n\n* On project delays \nThe main reason the project timeline is delayed (now by two years) is because the federal funding process cannot be paralleled with local funding. PRT found the process for city approvals to be the main bottleneck. My wife asked if there were any constructive lessons to learn here. PRT has hired someone full time to liaise with the city and get these approvals moving faster. They believe they are on track and do not anticipate further delays\n\n* On offboard fare\nPRT said the agency is committed to all-door boarding, but is not final on the methodology. They did say they *didn't* want an approach like select fare / sbs which you see in eg PDX, NYC (where a transit police officer comes on to the bus randomly to check tickets). So we'll have to see what enforcement mechanism they come up with\n\n* On branch lines \nI was under the impression that the branch lines were dead. According to PRT one of the branches (can't remember which) is funded as part of another project. The other is planned to roll into a future project. I believe what was meant here is that they will roll into the \"priority corridors\" like the kind you're seeing now in McKeesport which was planned under NEXT",

S. Steel and the USW applicable to USW-represented employees,\" U.S. Steel said. \n\n\n\nThe board cited Nippon's written commitments, including a promise not to conduct layoffs during the term of the contract and to invest $1.4 billion in union-represented facilities.  \n\n\n\n\"With the arbitration process now behind us, we look forward to moving ahead with our pending transaction with Nippon Steel,\" U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said in a news release. \"With the significant investments and contractual commitments from Nippon Steel, we will protect and grow U. S. Steel for the benefit of our employees, communities and customers. We look forward to collaborative discussions with the USW and all our stakeholders.\" \n\n\n\nSale to Nippon faces opposition\n\nWhile U.S. Steel says no further action is required under the basic labor agreement to move forward with closing the sale, the merger faces opposition from President Joe Biden.\n\n\n\nMultiple news outlets have reported that Biden plans to block the deal as soon as he receives a decision from the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS. But the White House has downplayed those reports, saying CIFUS is reviewing the deal for potential national security concerns and could advise against the merger.\n\n\n\nBoth former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have campaigned against the deal. \n\n\n\nBut U.S. Steel has warned that without the deal, thousands of jobs are at risk. And if the sale falls through, U.S. Steel says it \"raises serious questions\" about keeping its headquarters in Pittsburgh. \n\n\n\nThe $15 billion sale to Nippon Steel, Japan's largest steelmaker, was announced in December.",
