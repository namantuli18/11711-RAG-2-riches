While the case ended legal school segregation and declared separate educational facilities to be inherently unequal, the court did not guide the implementation of Brown v. Broad and left its enforcement to school districts. Ten years later, in 1964, the Civil Rights Act was signed, prohibiting discrimination in public places and employment. Civil Rights assisted in forcing the issue of removing discrimination, yet it did not provide a clear framework for school implementation for students or increasing minority hiring practices in the classroom. The execution of the ruling was met with resistance nationwide and led to challenges that continue to affect schools seventy years later. During this commemorative program, educators will discuss issues that stemmed from the decision and share resources and information on how to advocate for public education today. Current high school students and recent graduates will then present on a variety of topics affecting education to give attendees a sense of how the landmark decision has impacted schools for the last 70 years.

We hear in his own words how he fought to escape his Italian American roots and eventually made his way to Hollywood in the early years of the studio system. The film offers a candid portrait of a complicated man whose stories of hope in troubled times continue to speak to audiences today. Despite his humble beginnings, by the 1930s Frank Capra was perhaps the most successful and influential film director in the world. Today we still use the term Capra-esque to describe his particular kind of storytelling. But more than that, Capra’s films spoke to a public that was wearied by world events. The Great Depression was devastating lives, World War II was around the corner, and Capra’s movies were seen by many as a balm in troubled times.

There, he finds no-one is happy to welcome him back, and the arid settlement is about to be demolished to build large-scale factories. Haunted by the past and confronted with an uncertain future, Lang tries to get work as a ‘bounty hunter’ of stray dogs but ends up falling into an unlikely camaraderie with a rabid dog he’s forced to quarantine with. The film’s breakout canine star, Xiao Xin, was adopted by Peng after the shoot. The pair travelled to Cannes together, where Black Dog screened in the Un Certain Regard sidebar – and where Xiao Xin won the Palm Dog’s Grand Jury Prize. Filled with expansive imagery and percolating with sly cultural critique, Guan Hu’s poignant latest has earned comparisons to the work of Jia Zhang-ke (who appears herein as a dog hunter!). Depicting human–animal friendship without excessive sentimentality, Black Dog meets its titular character on his own terms, finding profundity in the interplay of two different but simpatico species.

Coined as an avant-anarcho ecosatire, the film envisions a post-apocalyptic landscape strewn with electronic detritus and suffering the toxic repercussions of mass marketing in a high-tech commodity culture. “Kill” is Dutch for stream, FRESH KILL tells the story of two young lesbian parents caught up in a global exchange of industrial waste via contaminated sushi. The place is New York and the time is now! Raw fish lips are the rage on trendy menus across Manhattan. A ghost barge, bearing nuclear refuse, circles the planet in search of a willing port. Household pets start to glow ominously and then disappear altogether. The sky opens up and snows soap flakes. People start speaking in dangerous tongues. A riveting and densely packed film, FRESH KILL evokes the furious rhythms of channel surfing with its rapid-fire editing style. ABOUT THE ARTIST: Born in Taiwan and now based in Paris, Shu Lea Cheang is an artist and filmmaker whose work aims to re-envision genders, genres, and operating structures. She began her career as a member of activist media collectives Paper Tiger TV and Deep Dish TV. Later, as a celebrated pioneer of Net Art, her work Brandon (1998–99) became the first-ever web-based artwork commissioned and collected by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Since 1994, she has produced four feature films, FRESH KILL (1994), I.K.U. (2000), FLUIDØ (2017), and UKI (2023), which encompass a new genre she calls “Scifi New Queer Cinema.” In 2019, she represented Taiwan at the Venice Biennale with the mixed media installation, 3x3x6. Over the years, Cheang has participated in many renowned international biennials, including Performa 19, New York; the 11th Taipei Biennial; the 50th and 58th Venice Biennale; and the 1992 and 1994 Whitney Biennials among others. Her works are included in the world’s key permanent collections for contemporary art, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; NTT InterCommunication Center, Tokyo; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and DSL collection, Paris.

Ani DiFranco crashed onto the music scene in the early ‘90s, a thundering new voice in the cultural wilderness, unapologetically bisexual, political and feminist. She toured relentlessly, thrashing out hundreds of frenzied shows that were part mosh pit, part hootenanny and part full-on tent revival, then selling cassette tapes from the trunk of her car to make it to the next gig. Ani became a worldwide phenomenon when she beat the male-dominated music industry at its own game by founding Righteous Babe Records, the first “woman-run non-corporate queer-happy” label, still going strong after nearly 35 years. The press called her “an entrepreneurial wonder” and “the industry’s worst nightmare.” Prince called her “my hero.” Ani simply called herself a folk singer, dedicated to art, activism and staying true to herself, no matter the cost. 1-800-ON-HER-OWN takes us on a wild cinematic road trip, from DiFranco’s punk-folk past to her life today as she reinvents herself as a passionate activist and revered rock star. Throughout the ride, she’s brutally honest, famously foul-mouthed and totally hilarious. Her daily challenges resonate as we reveal both an enduring, inspiring musical icon and a very relatable contemporary “everywoman” with her own epic fails and hard-won victories.

Following Q&A with Vidak, we'll screen ARIEL (1988) by Aki Kaurismäki. In a small village in Finland, which has relied solely on metallurgical activities for the past two centuries, Aki Kaurismäki and his friend, the poet and writer Mika Lätti, are constructing their own cinema within an old foundry. Employing recycled wood, metal, and pre-owned furniture, Kaurismäki and the residents of Karkkila collaboratively craft Kino Laika. The venue is surrounded by Cadillacs, motorcycles, rock bars, and the awe-inspiring beauty of nature, encapsulating the very essence of cinema’s enchantment – a place where the magic resides in its profound capacity to instigate change. In chronicling the creation of Kino Laika, Croatian-French filmmaker Veljko Vidak has created a modest yet finely-crafted film that is simultaneously a documentary about a particular cultural project, a more wide-ranging filmic meditation on the nature of cinema, and a portrait of a small-town community. Transcending the usual documentary trappings, CINEMA LAIKA radiates a deadpan charm and bemused curiosity about humanity that calls to mind nothing so much as the work of Kaurismäki himself. About Ariel: In Kaurismäki’s drolly existential crime drama, a coal miner named Taisto attempts to leave behind a provincial life of inertia and economic despair, only to get into ever deeper trouble. Yet a minor-key romance with a hilariously dispassionate meter maid might provide a light at the end of a very dark tunnel. ARIEL, which boasts a terrific soundtrack of Finnish tango and Baltic pop music and lovely cinematography by Kaurismäki’s longtime cameraman Timo Salmimen, put its director on the international map.

This special screening includes two classics directed by and starring Buster Keaton, and both with live accompaniment! First up is SHERLOCK JR (1924) with a live piano score by Tom Roberts: Keaton’s classic about a lovestruck projectionist who falls asleep during a show and dreams he has entered the film as a detective is a delightful and ingenious comedy. Sherlock Jr. is a high point of silent cinema, featuring one of Keaton’s cleverest conceits, and doubling as a reflection on cinema itself. About Tom Roberts: Tom Roberts is one of the leading scholars of early jazz piano in the world today (as stated by Ricardo Sciavales in The Heart and Soul of Stride, Blues, and Swing Piano). He has performed on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, The Statler Brothers Show on TNN, and A Prairie Home Companion with Garrison Keillor. Tom was pianist for Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks in New York City and pianist and musical director for Leon Redbone for six years. Tom has recorded over 40 compact discs and has performed throughout the United States and Europe. And then our second film, THE NAVIGATOR (1924), with a live score by The Pittsburgh Film Orchestra: In this revered silent comedy, the wealthy and impulsive Rollo Treadway (Buster Keaton) decides to propose to his beautiful socialite neighbor, Betsy O'Brien (Kathryn McGuire). Alhough Betsy turns Rollo down, he still opts to go on the cruise that he intended as their honeymoon. When circumstances find both Rollo and Betsy on the wrong ship, they end up having adventures on the high seas, allowing Keaton plenty of opportunities to display his trademark agility. About the Pittsburgh Film Orchestra: The Pittsburgh Film Orchestra began life in 2007 as the Ivy Leaf Orchestra, an ensemble formed to provide live musical accompaniment for silent films. Our first performance was for the 1917 Douglas Fairbanks feature, A Modern Musketeer. Since then the Pittsburgh Film Orchestra has provided music for a wide variety of classic comedies and dramatic films. The ensemble utilizes music published between 1885 and 1930, including hundreds of compositions specifically written for theatre orchestras and movie accompaniment. We call ourselves an orchestra even though by modern standards we’re really a chamber ensemble because that was the tradition in the silent era; as long as you had at least two instrumentalists, you had an orchestra! The PFO is a flexible ensemble (ranging from 2 to 22 players), and the ensemble emulates the best aspects of film accompaniment from the silent era to provide an emotionally and aesthetically satisfying viewing experience.

"{'title': 'Jerome Bettis is statistically the modern GOAT of 1 yard conversions', 'content': 'So, I\'ve seen discussions in the past debating, ""Who is the best short yardage back of all-time?"" or ""You need one yard to win the game. What RB do you trust most to get you one yard?"" The Bus is my favorite player of all-time and usually gets a mention or two, but I wanted to see if he was anything notable in this regard. I\'m sure we\'ve all seen the claims that Bettis isn\'t even a HOF quality player because (insert bias or dumb argument here). Or that he wasn\'t elite at anything or at any point. And everyone loves bringing up his 5 attempts, 1 yard, 3 TDs statline. I figured if Bettis excelled at anything, it would be converting short yardage situations... And boy, did he.\n\nA few caveats:\n\nI manually removed QBs from the data set, because QB sneak is cheating. /s\n\nThis data includes the regular season and the playoffs.\n\nObviously, the offensive line plays a big role in whether these runs are successful. I do not want to diminish that fact, but we can still try and look for patterns in the data.\n\nThis data is only from 1994 and on. 1994 is when the NFL began recording play-by-play history. That means Bettis\' rookie season (his best or second best) is not included.\n\nMore importantly, this ignores all other player data before 1994. The most relevant players before then are Emmitt Smith, John Riggins, and Marcus Allen. These are the only 3 players in NFL history with more 1-yard rushing TDs than Jerome Bettis. Without complete data, it is impossible to determine how efficient they were (without poring through footage of every single game). Smith and Allen are present in the data, but Allen only has his last 3 seasons, while Smith\'s epic prime stretch from \'91-\'93 is missing.\n\nHere is the 1 yard rushing TD leaderboard:\n\n1. John Riggins - 59 TDs\n2. Marcus Allen - 57 TDs\n3. Emmitt Smith - 54 TDs\n4. Jerome Bettis - 48 TDs\n\nAlright so with that out of the way, here are some charts I made. This first one is running back carries on any down with 1 yard to Goal. Jerome Bettis is the black starred data point.\n\n[https:\\/\\/stathead.com\\/tiny\\/kyp73](https://preview.redd.it/5h1z1vy3zesd1.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=c28faa94c7d906862b789da31b4f3675f0ae7751)\n\nSince 1994, Jerome Bettis has the most 1-yard touchdown runs of any player. The line of best fit also shows that he is well above the average success rate. In fact, of the top 25 RBs for attempted 1 yard TD runs, only three RBs have/had a higher success rate.\n\n|Player|TDs|Attempts|TD %|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|Jerome Bettis|41|67|61.19%|\n|Derrick Henry|34|53|64.15%|\n|Shaun Alexander|35|50|70%|\n|Ezekiel Elliott|30|45|66.67%|\n\nNext, if the question we\'re asking is ""You need one yard to win the game. What RB do you play?"" then we need to look at 3rd and 4th down conversions. Winning the game by converting a 3rd/4th and 1 and running out the clock is much more common than a 1-yard go-ahead rushing TD.\n\n[https:\\/\\/stathead.com\\/tiny\\/2FDQ5](https://preview.redd.it/0xfst44mzesd1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=79b59c4bc5175e576b62c58a021ac0891d1cc18e)\n\nOnce again, Jerome Bettis is the black starred data point. Since 1994, Jerome Bettis has the most 1st down conversions on 3rd or 4th & 1 of any running back. He is also above the line of best fit when charted with all RBs who attempted 70 or more of these conversions. Of the 25 RBs that have attempted the most 3rd or 4th & 1 conversions, only 6 have/had a better conversion rate. It is worth mentioning that Jerome Bettis also has the most attempts of any RB.\n\n|Player|First Downs|Attempts|First Down %|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|Jerome Bettis|126|181|69.61%|\n|Adrian Peterson|104|147|70.75%|\n|Ezekiel Elliott|105|134|78.36% (holy shit)|\n|Ahman Green|91|122|74.59%|\n|Derrick Henry|77|103|74.76%|\n|LeSean McCoy|73|103|70.87%|\n|Willis McGahee|71|100|71%|\n\nBased on this data, I think we can say that Jerome Bettis was both highly prolific and proficient at converting 1 yard possession downs and goal-to-go. He also never had any drop-off in this regard and was just as successful at the end of his career, which is not the case for most of these RBs.\n\nI expanded my focus a bit to also include downs that were 2 yards to go. These are also considered short yardage situations and are probably even more crucial because QB sneak efficiency drops dramatically with the extra yard.\n\n[https:\\/\\/stathead.com\\/tiny\\/Uf0nY](https://preview.redd.it/if8gsjntzesd1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4705d043bacbb46e707f631df8561f4530fe487)\n\n[https:\\/\\/stathead.com\\/tiny\\/22l8S](https://preview.redd.it/l6j27e0xzesd1.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff5c17bdee8472f75b759fc240ade234687e13c1)\n\nI won\'t go over these with a ton of detail, but Jerome Bettis remains the most efficient player among RBs that carried the rock as much as he did in these situations. He is in the top 5 in attempts and had a higher conversion rate than the rest of the top 5. Check out the shortened URLs below each chart if you want the full lists.\n\nI did a bunch of other charting, but I think the most interesting was this:\n\n[Jerome Bettis is the goal line GOAT](https://preview.redd.it/ofsh0xa30fsd1.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9090a578a49fbd7725ddd20e7a4981cab8499d5)\n\nOn specifically\xa0**3rd or 4th Down with 1 or 2 yards to goal**, Jerome Bettis has the second most attempts and TDs. Among RBs that attempted at least 12 carries, The Bus\' TD percentage is only exceeded by Priest Holmes, who had almost half as many attempts. Jerome Bettis also averaged an incredible 0.87 yards per attempt. Looking at the individual plays,\xa0**Bettis was literally never stopped for negative yardage in this situation.**\n\nAs mentioned, this data leaves out a lot of great players pre-1994. And Emmitt Smith scored 15 1- or 2-yard TDs before 1994. Hell, Bettis scored 4 TDs from 1 or 2 yards away in his rookie season. But this level of efficiency would be incredibly difficult to top. We all know about the fumble in Indy that almost sank the Super Bowl run. That one happened on 1st and Goal from the 2. It\'s honestly unbelievable how that went down, considering Bettis\' record up to that point. Despite that, if I\'m at the goal line and need to score to win the game, I\'m taking the Bus every time. \n\nCredit to Stathead and their one-month free subscription that I got just to satiate my curiosity.', 'date': '2024-10-02 21:59:01'}","Jerome Bettis is statistically the modern GOAT of 1-yard conversions, according to a comprehensive analysis of his 1-yard rushing touchdowns and goal-line performances."

"{'title': 'Addressing the QB situation', 'content': ""Due to the outrageous number of fans questioning Tomlin's decision regarding not starting Russell Wilson, I'd like to address a few things.\n\nTomlin is an elite strategist, especially excelling at making decisions based on analyzing information as it's delivered. Definitely a week to week process, while still building a long term strategy.\n\nJustin Fields coming to Pittsburgh, put him in a significantly different situation than when he was in Chicago. He's now in a better organization, with better coaches, better offense. Give him a chance to develop & get used to this offense. Keep in mind, starting Fields is giving the young QB who was in a much worse situation in Chicago, to keep his confidence & assuring him the organizations plans for him to become the future QB. Russell Wilson being a veteran QB, obviously knows this, & knows his role; he's 35 years old, he's a short term option. Pittsburgh is gonna utilize Wilson's veteran knowledge &  allow Russell to work with Fields & prepare the young QB to fulfill the role as the future QB we all need. \n\nSo far, Fields has showed continuous improvement. He's building chemistry & gaining familiarity with the offense, his passing charts reflects this every week. Why bench him? \n\nTomlin's approach is 'This is a MARATHON not a sprint'. Miami is a perfect example. They've got a decent team, but without Tua they fell off a fucking cliff. They put all their eggs into a single basket. Shoulda saved some cap space for a decent backup QB (especially given Tua's history), or at least had Thompson & Huntley build more chemistry (they obviously have minimal) with the offense during practice. Unlike Miami, Pittsburgh wouldn't be totally fucked if in a similar situation. As long as Fields is showing improvement & we continue to get dubs why start Russell? Always gotta have a backup plan. So far, no other team has had the opportunity to study film on how Russell will be utilized with the Steelers. Why show our hand just yet, when we don't need to? Maybe, Tomlin's letting Fields start the easy matchups we have now, & allowing Russell to heal up 100% while preparing him for the tougher divisional & other games (KC) we have after our bye week. Who knows, we don't know what's transpiring behind the scenes.\n\n It sucks as a die hard fan to see so many fellow Steelers as 'armchair coaches'  who think they could do better & doubt our HC who has proven he's one of the best coaches in history. \n\nRemember: Tomlin can't give you all the ingredients to the hotdog.

Apart from a few, granted, costly mistakes, Fields has put the team in the position to win games and did a good job bringing them back from behind at the end of the game yesterday until that sack stemming from not being ready for the snap. Right now, he is our best running back (Corderrelle Patterson might have something to say about that) and is our only other offensive weapon actually making plays other than Pickens. I feel like a QB change now would change the offensive dynamic we have going on even though that dynamic isn’t actually very dynamic.

However, I don’t think we as a fanbase should get lost in the moment and should recognize that there were some huge positives in the long term with this game.\n\n1. Fields has established himself as the QB1 for the foreseeable future. \nHonestly, i like russ and think he probably could do marginally better this season, but the reality is fields is 10 years younger. We need a QB and he seems to love the coaching here. It benefits him to stay here longer at least in the short term. We also need him. We haven’t had this level of QB play since ben’s later years. Not from mason, kenny, and certainly not mitch. Tomlin last year said “we are not built to come from behind” well Fields just showed we can now . \n\n2. The revelations that have to come from this game regarding harris.\nI am a day one najee fan. Love him to death as a human and still as a player. However, WE NEED TO MOVE ON. Main reason being we are not the team built for a Najee Harris. His ideal situation is a line with a good push at snap. He falls forward and with a good push line is getting 4-5 YPC on a line like that. We are a more “small hole/gap” line right now. Thats why our speedier RBs outplay him so often. Couple in the lack of receiving work and we simply have a round peg trying to squeeze into a square hole. \n\n3. Defense finally exposed.\nStart by saying we have a good defense. The issue is our comp has been fairly light these last few weeks. We finally played our most talented QB and most vet/accomplished/ seen it all QB in flacco/Richardson. This isn’t some mediocre team. They lsot one score games to teams better than we faced up to this point. A good check for the D and gives them things to focus on. ( honestly there were some game changing BS calls at the end , but in general there were some mistakes that fall squarely on the defense like tackling mechanics they can work on).\n\n4. Play calling on offense.\nIts clear now that there is some meat left on the bone between Fields capabilities and what we are willing to run on offense. This type of game should be perfect for Arthur Smith to obsess over game tape. Study what fields is comfortable with and what he struggles with. Put more plays into the scheme where he can thrive and remove anything (please god some of the 1st/2nd and long runs with Najee) that hasn’t worked. \n\n5. This was the best team we played in all.\nI think the colts are getting a really bad rap because of their record. They lost close games to teams that maybe better than the teams we beat. I don’t think its a crazy statement to say they are the best team we played at least QB wise. Richardson/flacco is better than 1/3 partial Herbert &  Heinicke. Also the chiefs just put up less points against this same team.\n\nIf we can address these issues I think the sky is the limit, but i recognize some of these issues are going to be long processes to work out.', 'date': '2024-09-30 07:08:33'}","The document discusses positive aspects of a recent football game, including Fields' development as a quarterback, the need to move on from Najee Harris, the defense's improvement, and the potential for offensive play calling changes."

"{'title': 'Week 4 snapshot: pros/cons', 'content': 'After about 4 weeks or so, quarter of the season, teams usually show for better or worse what the strengths and weaknesses are of their team. Tomlin and other coaches have mentioned this before including Belicheck whom all have somewhat said that each 4 week stretch in essence are small “seasons” within themselves and your trying to improve “season by season” in each 4 game stretch along the way which was how it was when the league operated on 16 games making 4 “seasons”. In the first “season” of 2024; here’s what I honestly can say most would agree on when it comes to most objective observations on the team:\n\nPros: \n-Qb Production: I wanted to make this an over arching term and not just favor one Qb or another even tho Justin has been the guy. As evidence of the last two games, and season so far overall against above the line defenses in each game, the Qb room has produced way more in the short time they’ve been here than years past. We all can agree to that from the eye test. \n\n-Talent/potential in the running game: The overall trajectory of the running game has more up than down….its just the right running back needs to be back there. This could almost be a con for Najee but I’m kinda out on him but memories serves he’s always like this early season. Perhaps he minimizes contact early to be a bruiser late? Idk but I’m just not a fan of how he doesn’t attack the Los as big as he is. Outside of him, there are LANES there. BIG GAPING LANES. Patterson hits them, Warren hits them, 22 does not. Even Fields is automatic for a few on designed runs most times so far. \n\n-Defense: despite the early performance don’t be confused, this defense has talent oozing and turns up when needed. \n\nTight ends: we need more plays for these guys. There is no excuse Washington isn’t being fed more. He’s literally 5 yards if he caught it slightly behind the line. He’s too big to not be used in space. \n\nAdjustments: Say what you will about Tomlin and TA, but this team is way different in the 2nd half. Despite the lost, I never truly felt we were out of it from what I was seeing. \n\nCons: \nYoung lineman: Reign these guys in and rein them in fast. I won’t spend too much time here cuz we all more or less know, the Steelers plan to have Jones, MCCormick, Frazier, Spencer, Fautaunu to be the line long term. Especially Frazier. I love what he brings up front but he had a couple “welcome to the nfl” moments before that last infamous snap. They all have strengths to their game but some Achilles heels to heal. \n\nWr 2 anyone?: I’ll get to Artie Smith in a second, but jeez I’m not seeing anyone get open. 14 has gotten better in terms of separation but that’s not the strength of his game. I’d have to see the film on what the passing concepts were but it doesn’t feel we got anyone else besides 14 to route up or bully a guy to get open, the latter more so what GP is better at. \n\nILB?: Queen does some things well. Payton does some things well. But let’s slow the hype on them being Ham and Lambert. Wilson has holes in his game. Plus he hasn’t filled into an nfl body yet imo. Queen I expected more from but he does show up. I can’t dunk on him completely. He works a lot of plays with a rookie running mate and when Wilson improves, so will Queen’s frequency showing up on film in a positive. For now, the middle is kinda vulnerable with them just beyond the Los. \n\nCoordinatorS!: There’s some things that Artie smith have done I like because seeing CP hit the lanes A Smith is trying to open up shows at times “ok, this can work.”  But again going back to 22, he’s just not hittin the lanes we need. Outside that tho….the play calling on 1st needs more variety. Idk if it’s a stubborn belief but u do NOT NEED TO RUN ON FIRST TO ESTABLISH THE RUN! Colts let us feed into their run heavy n hit us with play action to START THE GAME. Run was open for a while from there. Justin can make plays and there’s plays out there to be had on first down so that you CAN RUN on 2nd down or maybe this sounds crazy….JUST GET A FIRST DOWN ON FIRST DOWN! 🤦🏽\u200d♂️ then T Austin I’m not the biggest fan of. It really feels like they stay in the same defense most of the game and rely on the talent to just “talent” and when we DO SCHEME a blitz or coverage, surprise surprise we get sacks which is where the adjustments come into play to their credit. However. Leads to my last con.\n\nSlow Starts: in every game, whether it felt like it truly or not, this team has started sluggish. Every. Single. Game. THAT needs to change. \n\nOverall tho, I think this team has potential which is a dangerous word but how they go after that upper level of play is their decision to make. That all said, this team is definitely trending upwards from where it was a year ago. We still got some guys out rn and the full vision hasn’t come into effect yet. Just be patient. Today we lost but it’s not like we just ass now. The Colts were at home n had a lot to play for and had a good game plan.

How many of you just accept the information in charts like this without having read the [methodology](https://www.espn.ph/nfl/story/_/id/24892208/creating-better-nfl-pass-blocking-pass-rushing-stats-analytics-explainer-faq-how-work)? I usually just accept it tbh.  I found the chart above on r/AFCNorthMemeWar, so I decided to actually look into this. The stats are from ESPN Next Gen stats ([this article it seems](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/41040723/2024-nfl-win-rates-top-teams-players-rankings#prwr)). ESPN classifies every player represented above as an edge with no differentiation between five techniques, seven techniques or nine techniques, etc.\n\nRecently, it has been going around that some analytics are not taking chips into consideration. I have also seen some claim that double teams are only two linemen not a lineman and a TE or RB. However for Next Gen:\n\n>we tally double-teams regardless of the position combination, so running backs and tight ends count too.\n\nSo a double-team does not only represent two linemen.\n\n>Block-and-go-type releases by tight ends and backs who do not cross the line of scrimmage are no longer counted against them as pass-block losses (and no longer count as pass-rush wins for the defender who is released).\n\nSo it is correct that chips are not counted.\n\nHere is how it works:\n\n>\\[ESPN Next Gen Stats\'\\] Pass Block Win Rate metric tells us the rate at which linemen can sustain their blocks for 2.5 seconds or longer. Likewise, our Pass Rush Win Rate metric tells us how often a pass-rusher is able to beat his block within 2.5 seconds. Our model of pass blocking harnesses player tracking data from NFL Next Gen Stats.\n\nSo why 2.5 seconds? Well . . .\n\n>We chose 2.5 seconds for two reasons. First, it\'s about the average time to pass release on most conventional drop-back pass plays. It also appears to best separate the blockers and rushers we already know are good at what they do\n\nI think 2.5 is a a fair benchmark, tbh, but that ""blockers and rushers we already know are good at what they do"" does not seem very scientific.\n\n>Our model uses the location, proximity and orientation of each player relative to every other player throughout a play to determine who is blocking whom. When a pass-rusher beats his block, we can tell which blocker allowed the pressure. And just as importantly, we know how long after the snap it occurred.\n\nBut how do they determine whether one beats his block? Here is how:\n\n>The system also draws the pocket at each time step in a pass play. The pocket is defined as a polygon connecting all the pass blockers. When a rusher penetrates this polygon and is within a certain distance to the quarterback, we say he has won his block.\xa0\n\nSo, a computer is analyzing locations and time relative to the pocket and the QB. That ""within a certain distance"" part is a little shady in my view. Why can\'t we know what that distance is? Presumably, it\'d be 1-3 yards.\n\nOverall, given that pocket penetration, time and distance are the key factors, one might think that the system would favor IDL over edges. However, of the best IDL only three would make the top twenty in win rate on the Edge list. This is probably because of the stark difference in double-team rate.\n\nI\'d like to see the stats broken down by a technique. It seems that many of the top ten are more traditional defensive ends than what I would think of as an edge.\n\nMost will probably not read this, but I thought it was interesting to look into.', 'date': '2024-09-28 13:11:11'}","ESPN Next Gen Stats analyzes pass blocking and pass rushing win rates using player tracking data, distinguishing between different techniques and considering chips and double teams."

"{'title': 'Russel Wilson Trade Value', 'content': ""I am going to make a statement/assumption.  I think Mahomes pure talent level is similar to Fields.  If Fields and Mahomes swapped draft classes and the Chiefs drafted Fields and the Bears drafted Mahomes then today Fields would be a top 10 QB (maybe not Mahomes good) and Mahomes would be the Steelers starting QB.  Because the Bears suck at managing talent.\n\nI think Fields has shown enough that its reasonable to expect Arthur Smith can make him an above average QB.  I don't know his ceiling.  Athletically its very high, but maybe he lacks the processing talent to be elite.  But he's good enough and I trust our coaching staff to get it out of him that he is a viable long-term starter.  That means if we run with Fields all year he's going to costs us probably something like a 4 year 160 million extension.  Cheaper if we replace him with Russ then resign him to be the starter next year but that feels dishonest and only trying to keep his value down.\n\nOur QB depth is fantastic.  Even if Fields is the long-term starter he might get hurt and Russ is a super back-up.  From a pure trade value position it doesn't make sense to trade him for less than a second.  Because the insurance policy has value.\n\nStarting Russ is going to be the smart play to keep Fields contract cheaper.  If Fields just does what he's doing and doesn't improve its maybe 4 years 120, if he takes  a step-forward its costly.  But one reason we signed Russ is the Steelers do things the right way.  Which means going with the guy you think could be your long-term QB despite contract costs and giving Russ a chance to play this year and boost his HOF credentials.  Long-term I think treating players right has benefits.  Not the cutting Rowdy shit to save 200k.\n\nLets say the Dolphins approach us wanting Russ which has been rumored as a potential landing spot.  Would be a great landing spot for Russ to rebuild his career with a ton of offensive weapons and Tua probably should be retiring but will fight it out.  I wouldn't just give Russ away.  Being a desirable location for players to sign with we should utilize to our advantage.  Its a cap and draft league so gaining advantages is necessary.  I wouldn't push for a 2nd which might be fair value.  But something like a third and fifth works for me.  A third lets call it Darnell Washington isn't really worth the insurance policy of having Russ, but its something and treats everyone fairly.\n\nI assume Wilson wants to start this year to boost his long-term prospects and show something.  He's borderline HOF so he would prefer showing something this year to have a guaranteed starting job next year."", 'date': '2024-09-27 19:12:49'}",Russell Wilson's trade value depends on his performance and the team's strategy.

"{'title': 'Steelers QB play through 3 weeks 2023 vs 2024', 'content': 'A big reason I decided to look into this was because it seems in the media and among fans, Justin Fields is a fairly polarizing player when it comes to how effective/good he is.\n\nFor a very simple comparison here are their stats at a glance through 3 weeks for both:\n\nedit (could not get chart to work in reddit, quick and dirty screenshot instead):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbsbqrgau0rd1.png?width=1299&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1342708a646789d846df5999659d7a684125192\n\nSimple takeaways are that Fields accounted for around 90 less yards of offense total (pass + rushing yards) with 2 less interceptions. His completion percentage is much higher though, as well as his yards per attempt and adjusted yards per attempt. (Stats from PFR)\n\nAlthough what I was really interested in was depth of target, as many of us took issue with how little we stretched the field in the passing attack last year. For this I used fantasy pros advanced QB stats tool.\n\nHere are Kenny Pickett\'s stats through 3 weeks in 2023:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1scbdf5ak0rd1.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8afa5cd3cb220fd82f282d16c86c7de4910f1cd\n\n[https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php?year=2023&range=custom&start\\_week=1&end\\_week=3&team=PIT](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php?year=2023&range=custom&start_week=1&end_week=3&team=PIT)\n\nAnd here are Justin Fields stats through 3 weeks:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f36ncgpgk0rd1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=039d637d81b088e5b447560b1eb5f04104ffb1b2\n\n[https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php?range=custom&team=PIT&start\\_week=1&end\\_week=3](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php?range=custom&team=PIT&start_week=1&end_week=3)\n\nThe key takeaways are, in my opinion, Fields has .5 more air yards per attempt and Fields has less than half of Pickett\'s total poor throws, which if we extrapolate those to their attempts, Fields has a 14.6% poor throw rate and Pickett has a 23% poor throw rate. However, what is more reassuring is their respective rankings in some of these categories. If you sort the [first 3 weeks of the 2023 season](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php?year=2023&range=custom&start_week=1&end_week=3) by air yards per attempt, Pickett ranked 28th among all QBs with over 10 attempts. However, if you sort the [2024 season so far](https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/advanced-stats-qb.php) by air yards per attempt, Fields ranked 17th among QBs with 10 attempts or more. So while the .5 air yards per attempt may not seem like a lot, its a big difference in context of their performance relative to the league. Its also somewhat funny that Fields AY/A is 1.1 yards higher this year than it was at the same point last year for him, when he was ranked below Pickett.\n\nEven more reassuring though is the fact that while Fields was blitzed MORE times on LESS passing attempts than Pickett, he took 2 less sacks and was knocked down and hurried WAY LESS than Pickett, seemingly indicating that he is getting the ball out faster than Pickett did. I believe this is partially due to our offensive philosophy though since Fields seem to struggle in this aspect in his time in Chicago as well.\n\nOverall takeaway: our QB play has improved but in my opinion it\'s unclear that it\'s entirely player-based. It is pretty evident that at least some of this is Fields having aspects of his game that Pickett lacked. A reason I decided to look into this was too see if I could find any data to substantiate a perception I had that Fields is much more accurate than Pickett on deep passes. I found this chart:\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/throwthedamball\\/status\\/1836775399755223314\\/photo\\/1](https://preview.redd.it/0u6gz74rq0rd1.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc3ce87a00cb05b22ceab1cd8dd072a51c86a4bf)\n\nWhich only includes up to week two this year but seems to indicate a positive in that regard, but this would not be surprising, as this is a similar chart from last year:\n\n[https:\\/\\/x.com\\/throwthedamball\\/status\\/1729643835310145720\\/photo\\/1](https://preview.redd.it/5czi6wu0r0rd1.png?width=2088&format=png&auto=webp&s=946e06a0eb15d6398350c698b5268a650253de08)\n\nWhile not the same chart, Fields obviously trumps Kenny HARD in many deep ball statistics. As a whole, I really like our offensive philosophy this year.\n\nBut this brings me to my main point, I\'m not sure that Russ can\'t give us the same offense that Fields is. I do appreciate Fields but from the entirety of Tomlin\'s rhetoric in the offseason and leading to the start of this season, the plan was never for Fields to be the starter. Obviously, they seem pretty lax in getting Russ back from his somewhat mysterious calf injury that I\'ve only seen described as ""tightness"". It\'s also undeniable that Fields brings an aspect to the run game that Russ cannot, and Tomlin has said in the past he wants an athletic, mobile QB. If I had to guess, Fields likely gets the starting nod on a short leash if and or when Russ gets healthy. But if Russ becomes the starter when healthy I imagine he will also be on a short leash. If he comes in and is holding onto the ball too long, or taking too many sacks (neither of which being a problem Fields has this year and Russ has struggled with in the past) I can see Russ getting pulled mid-game even. What do you guys think?', 'date': '2024-09-25 21:11:07'}","Justin Fields' quarterback play has improved compared to his rookie season, with better air yards per attempt and fewer poor throws, but the team's offensive philosophy remains uncertain."

I haven\'t seen any new ""we won the trade"" or ""good riddance"" posts.\n\nNow that everyone\'s had time to digest, I wanted to take this opportunity to put the scapegoating to bed, celebrate an underrated Steeler, and remind everyone that historically, Johnson\'s statistical output has been a near-perfect barometer for QB quality. \n\n**1. Johnson as a barometer**\n\nJohnson is not a talent like Justin Jefferson or Ja\'Marr Chase, who can alter the course of a game in a single play. He is, however, an excellent separator with the speed and ball skills to excel with a variety of routes and catch points. He\'s basically the archetypal ""average starter"" in that he is consistently utilized and can do everything decently. As a result, his play has higher variance than that of bona fide superstars and/or scrubs. Those guys tend to perform the same regardless of who\'s under center, whereas Johnson will vary heavily based on how accurate, innovative, and consistent his target diet is. This variance makes Johnson\'s stats a very accurate litmus for QB quality.\n\nFor illustration, look at Johnson\'s statistics with each starting QB during their shared tenure:\n\n|QB|Total games|Passer Rating|Targets per game|Receptions per game|Yards per game|Touchdowns|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Ben Roethlisberger|31|90.5|9.84|6.09|62.8|15|\n|Mason Rudolph|20|80.2|7.05|4.6|61.4|8|\n|Mitchell Trubisky|13|76.5|8.15|5.46|59.9|3|\n|Kenny Pickett|21|79.1|7.81|4.2|47.9|2|\n|Devlin Hodges|8|71.4|6.5|4.25|42.6|2|\n\nThe obvious takeaway here is that Johnson\'s yardage and TD output is directly correlated to the quality of his QB during their shared tenure. With the exception of Pickett grading out marginally better than Trubisky, each descending QB has a worse passer rating, all the way down from late-career Big Ben to Devlin ""Duck"" Hodges. Moreover, I\'d argue each descending QB had/has a worse NFL career than the last. \n\n*(Please note: the sample size for Andy Dalton and Bryce Young, one and two games respectively, is very small. Johnson posted career-bests in each statistic under Dalton, who leads this group with a 123.6 passer rating during their time together. He posted career-worsts in each with Young, who anchors the group with a 44.1. Although it greatly illustrates my point, I didn\'t include this in the chart because it felt dishonest to cite so small a sample.)*\n\nThe numbers are similar when you look at overall passing offense in relation to Johnson\'s involvement:\n\n|Season|Team Passing Offense Rank|Targets per start|Receptions per start|Yards per start|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2019|31st|7.7|4.9|56.7|\n|2020|15th|11.1|6.8|71|\n|2021|15th|12.1|7.6|82.9|\n|2022|24th|8.6|5.1|65.2|\n|2023|25th|7.9|4.6|55.2|\n\nThe takeaway here is that the more involvement Johnson gets, the better his passing offense has performed. Maybe there\'s a chicken-egg conversation to be had here (i.e., does involving Johnson make an offense better, or do good offenses incidentally involve Johnson more), but there is at the very least a strong correlation between his counting stats and the team\'s overall passing finish. \n\nAll this is to say, it\'s pretty clear that Johnson is a capable, talented player performing as well as possible given his circumstances. He goes the way of his QB. \n\n**2. Johnson as a Steeler**\n\nReliable three-level target in a horrible situation, was the sole competent offensive player for large stretches of the post-Ben era. All-Pro returner, Pro Bowl receiver. 77 games, 67 starts, 4363 receiving yards, 391 receptions, 25 touchdowns. Took a team-friendly deal, helped mentor budding star George Pickens out of drop issues. \n\nThe chart below summarizes his contributions succinctly:\n\n|Question|Yes|No|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|950+ yard 17-game pace|X||\n|Cool arm sleeves|X||\n|Got Mitchell Trubisky benched|X||\n|Legal issues||X|\n|Played with a top-10 passer at any point in his career||X|\n|Satisfied with losing||X|\n|Traded for a player the worst team in the NFL was about to cut|X||\n\n**3. Johnson as a scapegoat**\n\nSince he was drafted in 2019, the Steelers have struggled to recapture the offensive magic of the Killer B\'s era. How much of this is on him? Let\'s examine the evidence.\n\nThe team\'s quality of offensive personnel took a nosedive. Le\'Veon Bell and Antonio Brown departed in varying stages of mental breakdown. Ben Roethlisberger destroyed his elbow. The offensive line was decimated by age and injury, and instead of spending money or high picks to retool it, Kevin Colbert built from the outside in. His cornerstone offensive picks to close his career were a contested catch WR who can\'t jump, a slow RB, a brittle TE, and a skittish QB. The post-Ben quarterback room needs not mentioning- you\'ve watched the games. It\'s also worth noting that this team has been a bottom-10 spender on offense since 2019, placing lowest in the league in both 2022 and 2024. \n\nThe organization hired poorly. I\'m not going to get into a debate over whose fault it is (i.e., whether Tomlin\'s a nepotist or Rooney\'s a cheapskate) because there\'s no way to know and we\'re stuck with both guys forever regardless. What I do know if *whoever* decided to hire Randy Fichtner and Matt Canada really screwed up. The organization has chosen unqualified, bad assistants, and it\'s really that simple. \n\nMost importantly, Ben\'s elbow injury in 2019 led Mike Tomlin to drastically reinvent his coaching philosophy. When Roethlisberger went down, the team relied exclusively on defense and clock control offense to win games. With a poor line, inexperienced QBs, and skill position rooms that hadn\'t recovered from losing Bell and Brown in rapid succession, Tomlin turned the Steelers into a dink-and-dunk powerhouse. The team ran the ball, targeted the short perimeter, and focused on protecting possession and field position. It led to exciting games, worked somewhat well, and proved replicable. Tomlin has not really asked his offenses to do anything since. \n\nIn short, the Steelers offense lost talent, chose poor coaches, and shifted to a philosophy that de-emphasizes scoring and yardage. \n\nHow is that Johnson\'s fault? See the helpful chart below:\n\n|Issue|Culprit|Explanation|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Every player retires, gets injured, or goes insane; Colbert forgets how to GM for 5 years|D. Johnson|???|\n|Two very bad offensive coordinators hired|D. Johnson|???|\n|Mike Tomlin concludes accruing yards is boring, attempts to become first coach to win a game with negative yardage|D. Johnson|???|\n\n***Hmmm, not really adding up. Why is Johnson so hated?*** \n\nI\'d posit three reasons. \n\nFirst, he had a handful of high-profile third down drops in 2020. Since then, he has been statistically one of the league\'s most reliable pass-catchers, with drop rates on par with ""safety blanket, QB\'s best friend"" type guys like Keenan Allen. Unfortunately, when a player develops the ""bad hands"" reputation, fans tend to notice and react more negatively to drops. Fans consider players like Adam Thielen, Christian Kirk, and Courtland Sutton to be far more reliable targets than Johnson, yet last season, each had a drop rate more than twice as high as Johnson\'s with similar target volume and QB play. You don\'t hear people complain about it because people care more about vibes than statistics.\n\nSecond, Johnson moves laterally or even backwards to try to get more yards. This is a common strategy used by players who are fast and good at football. The strategy can be frustrating to watch, though- the Steelers don\'t know what spacing is and Johnson isn\'t the strongest, so moving in that way often ended up losing yards. Johnson\'s running style after the catch was totally understandable- the post-Ben QBs rarely hit him in stride. If I caught one good ball a month, I\'d try to turn it into a home run, too. \n\nLastly, Johnson showed frustration in highly visible ways. He cussed out Mitchell Trubisky for sucking at football, leading to Trubisky being benched. He aggressively called for the ball when routinely missed by Kenny Pickett. He missed a Jaylen Warren fumble against Cincy and stood there while someone else picked it up, which looks really bad if you pretend he saw the fumble occur. Grave offenses, all of them. \n\nChart below:\n\n|Crime|Punishment|\n|:-|:-|\n|Improved catching|Offender labelled ""unreliable"" until the end of time|\n|Tried to turn monthly Good Target into big play|HE CAN\'T GO NORTH AND SOUTH!!!! AHHHH|\n|Acted upset when the offense sucked|Offender traded to only team in the league with a starting QB worse than Kenny Pickett|\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe statistics are what they are. Diontae Johnson is not a boogeyman, a bum, or a diva. He\'s a competent starting WR and a mirror to a his team\'s QB play. I\'m wishing him good luck and crossing my fingers that the vocal minority will drop the constant, tired complaining about him.', 'date': '2024-09-24 21:33:25'}","Diontae Johnson had a career outing despite the Steelers' struggles, and his statistics correlate positively with their quarterback's quality."

The coaches want to see how these guys look with each of the groups. \n\nObviously, tonights group, aside from Gruden, Koivunen, and Kopanen, are otherwise the forward group who will play against the Rags on the 9th.  So, I dunno, maybe nothing to it... maybe something. \n\nMy best guess right now, in light of last night is that we go into the season with 8 defensemen and 13 forwards.   The top 6 is set DOC-Sid-Rust, Bunting-Geno-Rak. 3rd Beauv-Eller-Glass, 4th Lizotte I think is the only 100% lock.  Then you have: Acciari/Hayes, Ponomarev/Poolparty.  To me this is the competition remaining.  \n\nThe thing that sucks is the guy I want to see the most is the one that's waivers exempt - Pono.

All of which can add to the story of your player. Once you’ve earned these points you can apply them to your player. Want to be a playmaker? Load up on passing! Do you want to drive to the net with the puck on a string? Increase your Stick Handling and Deking. It's your player, your career, your choice.\n\nOne of the greatest parts of the VHL is that we are a diverse community of hockey fans who share a common interest in building players, creating stories, and watching our very own players make it to the Hall of Fame. As a user, you also have the chance to manage a team, create lines, negotiate contracts, and much more.\n\nAll of our games are run through the Simon T Hockey Simulator, and when the season is in full swing you can expect daily simulations, some chirping, and a lot of fun. Watch as your player grows from being someone no one knows in the Victory Hockey League Minors, to a rising star in the Victory Hockey League Europe, and finally a superstar in the Victory Hockey League.\n\nNo matter what, even if you just want to check us out, we have a great community of people who will help you learn, answer your questions, and may even become some of your greatest friends.\n\nTo find out more join our Discord server:\xa0[https://discord.gg/RYvexVB4](https://discord.gg/RYvexVB4)\xa0and visit our website, [https://vhlforum.com/](https://vhlforum.com/) and [https://vhlportal.com/](https://vhlportal.com/)"", 'date': '2024-09-03 02:12:05'}",Create your own ice-hockey player in the Victory Hockey League.

"{'title': 'Potential Inspiration for Rutger Deciding To Leave Winnipeg', 'content': 'I don\'t know if it\'s just my micro-obsession with hockey or perhaps the sunk cost fallacy from following Brayden Yager so closely over the last year and a half (seriously, I watched the WHL playoffs in 360p for nothing), but I\'ve been consuming a lot of media on Rutger McGroarty over the past 72 hours. I feel like I may have stumbled across the catalyst for Rutger deciding to call his own shot regarding where he begins his NHL career.\n\nSo, I don’t usually watch Daily Faceoff but I found an [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikkZZm7R7tI&t=3304s) of *Morning Cuppa Hockey* featuring Rutger McGroarty fresh off his gold medal win at the WJC. The irony of this episode is that there\'s a 30-minute cold open with Frank Seravalli, prior to Rutger joining the show, discussing his teammate and alternate captain of the WJC USA team, Cutter Gauthier, who decided not to sign with the Philadelphia Flyers and who was ultimately traded.\n\nWhat’s particularly interesting about this interview is that one of the co-hosts, Colby Cohen, used to play for Rutger\'s dad in the USHL. Cohen has hinted in this interview and others that he has known Rutger since he was a kid and still talks to him personally in some capacity. Whether or not he was involved in Rutger’s decision-making is purely speculative, but a lot of the discourse shared during this episode and later on was... intriguing.\n\nFrank Seravalli had an interesting take in this episode on players calling the shots, similar to NBA players:\n\n>*""I actually like that, by the way. Players have control. They have a voice. If you don\'t want to play, use your voice. Get to where you want to get to. That\'s the deal. You\'re put in a lottery situation where the fate of your career is in the hands of someone else. You say, \'you know what, I don\'t want to go to the place where I was drafted. Who says I have to?\' When you\'re a college player especially, you have a 4-year clock. The Flyers had until 2026, essentially, to wait this out. I have no issue with players using their voice to get to where they want. That\'s how life should be.""*\n\nColby Cohen in a later episode/clip after Rutger decided he wanted to leave Winnipeg:\n\n>*""Does the NHL need to change the rules to force players to sign with teams that draft them? Absolutely not. Think of the leverage teams have every day. They make an offer, you don\'t like it, they say okay bye. They don\'t like the way you play, they send you to the minors. How about all the draft picks that NHL teams don\'t offer a contract to? That happens every year as well. So I understand as a fan you get upset when these things happen, but you\'ve got to remember something: teams exercise their leverage every day. Players are allowed to do the same thing. We see it in every sport and every player, young and old. Players that have leverage should be able to exercise their leverage because teams do the exact same thing in every single situation. Teams guilt you into things. They hold things over your head. They do kind of shady, dirty stuff behind the scenes all the time. A lot of it never makes it out publicly, so just understand that when you\'re kind of looking at this situation and you want to be very angry at a 21-year-old kid.""*', 'date': '2024-08-26 17:29:04'}","Rutger McGroarty's decision to leave Winnipeg may be influenced by insights from a Daily Faceoff episode featuring Frank Seravalli, who discussed players' rights to call the shots in the NHL."

Instead of getting one big name forward with their cap space they got players like Glass, Hayes, Lizotte, and Beauvillier. Now the younger players really don’t have a shot at the big leagues since there’s a huge logjam of bottom tier players and the big league roster doesn’t have the juice necessary to be competitive against other teams. We’re stuck in the middle. The way to actually do this would’ve been to sign one big caliber forward and let the existing youth come up and give it a shot. Their production on the 3rd/4th would’ve been better than these guys mentioned above.

"{'title': 'Revisiting the Erik Karlsson Trade One Year Later: a tale of two offseasons', 'content': 'Three hundred and sixty-six days ago the Penguins made a blockbuster trade that had the attention of the entire national hockey league and the fanbase of all 32 teams, when it sent a 2024 1st round pick, a 2025 2nd round pick, Mikael Granlund, Jan Rutta, Casey DeSmith, and Jeff Petry out the door to San Jose and Montreal.\n\nThe first round pick ended up with Buffalo, and turned into Konsta Helenius.  While I am not making a prediction about his future, I think he shows good value and was not some sort of oddity here.  There was also a 2025 2nd rounder, which is going to 46 overall going to the Habs. The other pieces that came back in the direction of Pittsburgh have been shuffled off, and the result is getting rid of 4 troubling players and bringing in one defensive superstar.  \n\nSo, one year later, how do we feel about the trade?  My gut reaction is that in a vacuum, I\'m still very pleased with this trade.  We had 4 pieces that we really needed to move, and that no one wanted.  3 of them were on awful contracts:  2 seasons of washed Petry at 6.25; 2 x 2.75 for an even more washed Rutta; and an inexplicable 2 more years at 5 mil for Granlund.  (other cap details, Pens retain 1.56 on Petry, SJ 1.5 on Karlsson).  There was no possible way to move those players, even for future considerations without giving away some picks.  However, giving away a first is interesting in light of this very different offseason. \n\nRegardless, Karlsson was good to great with some very Karlsson moments last season.  I would expect him to be even more comfortable and effective this season.  Given that, I cannot say this deal was not an effective way of improving the team.  Those 4 subtractions without addition would have been a boost, but we also added a great offensive defensemen.  \n\nWhat does make this trade look the most suspect however, is the quick about face Kyle Dubas has done from last season to this one.  Last offseason, the message was clear - he was reloading, reshaping this team, and trading away 1st rounders to win now. Then trading a 3rd rounder to get a consistent scorer for the top 6 (in Smith, who just did not work out).  This offseason, the message that Kyle gives in press conferences is similar, but his actions speak volumes.  He is not willing to move any picks for any players.  Several young RFAs were openly making it known that they wanted out.  But no picks were parted with for even elite young players.  Now, we don\'t know what could have been offered, but we have not heard a peep about any attempted signing other than Tarasenko, to whom we allegedly made a slightly worse offer than the one he accepted.  Trade rumors involving the team have been non-existent. \n\nInstead, this offseason, Kyle is willing to take on absolutely washed players - the kind he spent picks to get rid of just last year, if he can get a pick with them.  Kevin Hayes has been effectively cut by two bad NHL teams in a row.  First, Philly dumped him, retaining 50% of his salary (3.5), then he was so bad last season that even at half his salary St. Louis needed him gone. His adv stats were all declining. His movement was greatly declining. Doug Armstrong\'s statement spoke volumes:  ""This is just a situation where it wasn\'t working,"" the Blues GM said. ""I made a decision a year ago that I thought it could work for three years, and as the year progressed, it didn\'t look like it was working for either side. But when you put it down on paper, it wasn\'t a shining moment for myself.""\n\nSo, a team that desperately needs to get younger, who\'s star players Side & Geno have publicly spoken out saying we need more young fast players injected into this roster, is instead letting what are likely the last two season of Geno\'s NHL career be thrown down the toilet for a super slow, half committed rebuild.  The team just got older and slower, in exchange for a 2nd round pick (17% chance of being an NHL player).  That\'s the move of an overt rebuild, particularly after the very sound trade of Jake Guentzel for viable prospects and a legitimate player in his late 20s. \n\nThat\'s what I find curious and curiouser about the two offseasons.  The message being delivered from Dubas is consistent, but the actions taken are diametrically opposed.  One season adding a $10 million superstar with term in exchange for picks, adding a $5million contract for a scorer for a 3rd round pick, then the next taking player/cap dumps for picks, and adding a 1 year contract on a 30 year old Dman in need of a career turnaround, and retaining salary on Smith for picks. Those things all scream full rebuild in progress.\n\nAnyway, that\'s it - just two very different offseasons by action, while the team and Kyle oddly refuse to admit what they\'re doing.  What\'s everyone\'s temperature on the Karlsson trade a year out?  Would you do it again, knowing what you know a year later?   Would it have been better to keep those picks, play out last season and those contracts.  Try to move Granlund without giving up as much?  Does any of this have anything to do with Sid\'s contract not being extended yet?  \n\ntldr: this post is as long as A Tale of Two Cities, what do you think about the Karlsson trade a year later, and in light of the change in direction between the two offseasons?', 'date': '2024-08-08 18:12:11'}","A year after the Erik Karlsson trade, the Penguins have improved their defense with a top-tier defenseman while losing four problematic players. Kyle Dubas' shift in strategy from last season to this one is concerning, as he is unwilling to move picks for any players."

Obviously Kyle and Wes thought highly of him.  Rightfully so, he was better than a point per game for the Petes leading into the draft, and then after being taken crushed as a 19 year old with 86 points in the O.  \n\nLast year he got 56 games, which isn't terrible, but they were short on minutes and quality.  He got about 11 minutes per gamee, and still managed 14 goals - which would have put him 8th on the Pens in scoring. Compare him to Puusty, who had 52 games, 11:45 a night, got opportunities to pop into the top 6, and got 5 goals on the year.\n\nSo, of course he's a good young player, the questions are:  what does it cost to get him?  what should this team spend. \n\nI'm of the opinion that you spend a 2nd and 4th without blinking. This is an opportunity to ensure a great return on that 2nd rounder.  This kid is already showing enough return, right now.  However, his ceiling is high, and we get to fastforward 3 years on his development.   Honestly, I think a 2nd and 3rd would be fine here. \n\nWith this kid, this team will have loaded the short term cupboard in such a quick turnaround. Also, giving a young guy like this the chance to play with Sid could be huge for his development.  Worst case it could skyrocket his value if the rebuild is taking longer and you want to move on.

"{'title': 'Most important Contract, aside from 87??', 'content': 'Obviously, we\'re all waiting on the announcement in 16 days of Side\'s extension.  \n\nHowever, we have two other very compelling players up for extensions as well. Of Course, I\'m referring to DOC and Marcus Pettersson.  Their situations could not be more different, but I\'m of the opinion that both needs are very pressing, and should not wait until the season. \n\nLet\'s start with Pettersson - he\'s a ""home-grown"" defensive stalwart.  A 2014, 2nd rounder from the Ducks, acquired by the Pens in 2019 for Daniel Sprong, and was put right to work, eventually growing into the 5 year 20 million contract that he\'s finishing up this year.  \n\nPettersson is a lanky, rangy, if not terribly physical defensemen, who makes up for that lack of brute force with positioning, leverage, and technique.  Frankly, his net front battle against true power forwards in the league might be one of his few remaining areas to improve (along with finishing, but what do you expect from your defensivemost D).  He\'s 28, at the prime of his career, and is a sought after commodity. \n\n The market is not particularly strong for stay at home D - even the top guys.  Brenden Dillon, who you would have to consider a comp, just got 3 years at 12 million.  While a different player, Marino\'s contract is interesting for comp - 4.4 x6. Pelech is 5.75x8; Martinez ; Zub 4.6x4; Zadorov 5x6.Pettersson is most certainly not in the realm of Gustav Forsling, who just signed 8x5.75.  \n\nWhat would I do with Pettersson - offer him whatever term it took to get him signed for under 5 million per season, so long as he has not trade control.  From his perspective, why would he want to sign here longer than 3 years?  I don\'t see it.  So, sign him for however long he wants, but just be sure he has no more than 10 team after 3 years.  He will be a valuable trade asset at any point, and if we have him for some term at a reasonable price, he\'s even more valuable.  I\'d hate to see the Pens mismanage this asset, going into the season, without having extended him, and then trade him for so much less return.  Even during a rebuild, he could be a real leader on the blue line.  \n\nDOC - he\'s in a very different position.  He just had his first real NHL experience, and acquitted himself where playing with more different players than probably anyone on the squad.  He centered lines, he was wing with 4 different centers, and he finished the season playing 17 games or so on the first line.  Now, I\'ve seen some people looking at ADV stats and saying, man, this line was a huge + before him, then ended up -3 with him. However, keep in mind that his first games on teh 1st line were right after the Jake trade, when the whole team stopped skating in protest.  That, for the record is what cost us the playoffs, not the rest of the conjecture. \n\nAnyway, DOC put up 16G17A, and is a 6\'3\'\' 26 year old.  Sure, he\'s a bit of a late bloomer. That cannot be challenged. He was a point per game player in the Ivy league, and got himself signed for that. His first season in WBS 20 games 19 points, 2nd 33 games 32 points, then 22 in 20.  He\'s exactly a PPG in at the AHL level over 3 season, before getting his full time run. He also did well in his early runs with the big club, putting up points, and playing bottom 6, PK, etc.  Making the most of opportunity.  Keep in mind his first seasons were between the clubs in the pandemic seasons - a true mess of a situation for player dev. \n\nWhat would I do:  4years at 3 million would be my target for him.   I would want him through the end of the run with the boys, and maybe a bit beyond - he could be a primary part of the next Pens, or he could be traded in 3 years for a great return if he keeps on this trajectory and we have him locked in a good deal.  Frankly, if they went 5x3.5 I wouldn\'t hate it, but that\'s probably the end.  Let\'s keep the fingers crossed that his want to play with Sid, gets him to resign cheap, and really make a name for himself. \n\n  \nLook forward to your thoughts, boys.  July is almost over at least.', 'date': '2024-07-22 17:30:17'}","The document discusses the importance of extending contracts for two players, Marcus Pettersson and David Desharnais (DOC), due to their pressing needs and potential value."
