The selected works highlight depictions from contemporary urban and rural life, to historical events occurring in, and after Yugoslavia, specifically between the 1980s and today, as photography has mirrored the changes in political and ideological systems and their effects on cultural values. However, at the exhibition’s core, is the exploration of documentary practices through artworks that are the results of long-term research, demonstrating how photography can capture and decode the ways in which people perceive, and interact with, changing realities. The work of these Serbian artists and collectives encapsulates Serbia’s transition from a socialist to capitalist state through: personal memories; historical revisionism; the legacy of Yugoslavia’s industrial heritage; a significant period of isolation during the 1990s when Yugoslavia fell apart; and commentary on life in Serbia today. The range of themes provides diverse perspectives on photography, and allows viewers access to Serbia’s complex historical, and rich artistic, narratives – reinforcing the notion that the human landscape is multifaceted, and that all places across the world are in a constant state of transition. The Wind Got Up in the Night and Took Our Plans Away is accompanied by a monthly film program at the Harris Theater showcasing the work of Serbian documentary filmmakers, and a public art installation by the collective Belgrade Raw in Downtown Pittsburgh’s alley, Tito Way.

The removal and relocation was coordinated with the involvement of federal, state, and city officials in consultation with concerned citizens and professionals using processes outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. The mosaic panels have since been carefully conserved by McKay Lodge Conservation Laboratory and reinstalled at a new location in the Steel T Plaza Station in Downtown Pittsburgh. During this conversation on one of Pittsburgh’s most celebrated artists, panelists will provide insight into how the artwork was created, its connection to the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s mid-20th century redevelopment of the Lower Hill District, and the role the federal and state governments played during the life of the mosaic. Following the discussion, there will be a reception with light refreshments, sponsored by the History Center’s Italian American Program, Preservation Pittsburgh’s Modern Committee, and the City of Pittsburgh. The program is free with advance registration. For access to History Center exhibitions, regular admission rates apply. The event will take place in the History Center’s fifth floor Mueller Center. Virgil David Cantini (1919-2009) was born in Pietransieri, Italy. He immigrated with his family to Weirton, West Virginia in 1930 to escape the rise of Fascism under Mussolini. Artistic and athletic, Cantini was an All-American quarterback and received a football scholarship to play in college. He attended Manhattan College of Technology in New York before transferring to Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). His education was interrupted by World War II when he volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army’s Engineering Corps as a modelmaker and topographer. He returned from his service in 1946, graduated from college, and married fellow artist Lucille Kleber. They lived and worked in their home on South Craig Street in Oakland, raising two daughters. In 1948, Cantini earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Pittsburgh, where he later taught and helped to create the Fine Arts Department. He chaired the department until his retirement in 1989. He became an Associate Professor of Fine Art at the University of Pittsburgh in the early 1950s after teaching ceramics for four years at Schenley High School. His local and national profile grew as he participated in group and solo exhibitions. He was named one of Time Magazine’s “Leaders of Tomorrow” in 1953 and won the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts’ Artist of the Year in 1956. Cantini was active among professional organizations, such as the Sculpture Society, the Craftsmen Guild, and the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh. He won a Guggenheim Fellowship to return to Europe to study his craft in 1957 and the Pope Paul VI Bishop’s Medal in 1964 for his contributions to liturgical art.

Fleetwood will discuss how art can heal and humanize in the age of mass incarceration. More than two million people are currently behind bars in the United States. According to Dr. Nicole R. Fleetwood, incarceration not only separates the imprisoned from their families and communities, but it exposes them to deprivation, abuse, and arbitrary cruelties of the criminal justice system. Despite that, many of America’s prisons are filled with art. Despite the isolation and degradation they may experience, the incarcerated are driven to assert their humanity in the face of a system that dehumanizes them. A MacArthur Genius Fellow, curator, art critic, and author of the award-winning “Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration,” Dr. Nicole R. Fleetwood will reveal her unique perspective on how the imprisoned use art to express the visual culture of incarceration and its current impact on contemporary art. Dr. Fleetwood’s lecture will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience and a book signing.  $10 General Admission $5 Members Free for Students with a Valid ID This program will take place in the Mueller Center on the museum’s 5th Floor. Nicole R. Fleetwood is the inaugural James Weldon Johnson Professor of Media, Culture, and Communication in the Steinhardt School at New York University. A MacArthur Fellow, she is a writer, curator, and art critic whose interests are contemporary Black diasporic art and visual culture, photography studies, art and public practice, performance studies, gender and feminist studies, Black cultural history, creative nonfiction, prison abolition and carceral studies, and poverty studies.  She is the author “Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration” (Harvard University Press, 2020), winner of the National Book Critics Award in Criticism, the John Hope Franklin Publication Prize of the American Studies Association, the Susanne M. Glasscock Humanities Book Prize for Interdisciplinary Scholarship, and both the Charles Rufus Morey Book Award in art history and the Frank Jewett Mather Award in art criticism.

Where traditional mapmaking creates rigid understandings of constructs like nationhood, gender, and language, this exhibition offers fluid systems of way-finding between shifting and interlaced worlds. A dance is re-choreographed, an altar calls the past into the present, discarded objects find a new sense of value, and sensory fragments from childhood are restaged. Memory plays a vital role across the works on view, exploring how a body can chart through space on its own terms.

This presentation will familiarize attendees with the evolution of family surnames and the practice of patronymic naming. Recognizing the components of patronymic naming, participants will learn how to take advantage of these clues to link their family through generations. Nolan Altman will review an actual case study using headstone inscriptions and will show participants online resources to help find headstone information. Altman will also show examples of headstones and explain what you’re likely to find if you take a trip to the cemetery. He will explain the meaning of symbols that you will find on stones. Even if you can’t read Hebrew, you can understand the inscriptions. He will also show many examples of inscription trends, some odd inscriptions, and errors in inscriptions…even well-known ones. With a presentation on cemetery records, you wouldn’t expect to leave laughing, but he guarranties you will. This program is possible through the generous support of the William M. Lowenstein Genealogical Research Endowment Fund of the Jewish Community Foundation. “Patronymic Naming and Cemetery Research” is a collaboration between the Jewish Genealogy Society of Pittsburgh and the Rauh Jewish Archives at the Heinz History Center. Please register online. The program is free for JGS-Pittsburgh members and $5 for the general public. To become a member of the JGS-Pittsburgh and receive a free membership code for this program, please visit its website . This program will be recorded and made available to current JGS-Pittsburgh members.  Nolan Altman was bit by the “genealogy bug” when he was inspired to write his family history in 1996 in memory of his mother. After making use of the valuable information on JewishGen , he volunteered to do data entry on various projects. In time, he was asked to become the Coordinator for JewishGen’s Holocaust Database and subsequently the Coordinator for the JOWBR (JewishGen’s Online Worldwide Burial Registry) project. Nolan works with volunteers from around the world helping to grow both databases for the benefit of family members and researchers. Nolan currently holds the position of JewishGen’s Director for Data Acquisition and focuses on growing the JOWBR , Holocaust and Memorial Plaques databases.

A Jason Isbell record always lands like a decoder ring in the ears and hearts of his audience, a soundtrack to his world and magically to theirs, too. Weathervanes carries the same revelatory power. This is a storyteller at the peak of his craft, observing his fellow wanderers, looking inside and trying to understand, reducing a universe to four minutes. He shrinks life small enough to name the fear and then strip it away, helping his listeners make sense of how two plus two stops equaling four once you reach a certain age -- and carry a certain amount of scars. “There is something about boundaries on this record,” Isbell says. “As you mature, you still attempt to keep the ability to love somebody fully and completely while you’re growing into an adult and learning how to love yourself.” Weathervanes is a collection of grown-up songs: Songs about adult love, about change, about the danger of nostalgia and the interrogation of myths, about cruelty and regret and redemption. Life and death songs played for and by grown ass people. Some will make you cry alone in your car and others will make you sing along with thousands of strangers in a big summer pavilion, united in the great miracle of being alive. The record features the rolling thunder of Isbell’s fearsome 400 Unit, who’ve earned a place in the rock ‘n’ roll cosmos alongside the greatest backing ensembles, as powerful and essential to the storytelling as The E Street Band or the Wailers. They make a big noise, as Isbell puts it, and he feels so comfortable letting them be a main prism through which much of the world hears his art. He can be private but with them behind him he transforms, and there is a version of himself that can only exist in their presence. When he plays a solo show, he is in charge of the entire complicated juggle. On stage with the 400 Unit, he can be a guitar hero when he wants, and a conductor when he wants, and a smiling fan of the majesty of his bandmates when he wants to hang back and listen to the sound. The roots of this record go back into the isolation of the pandemic and to Isbell’s recent time on the set as an actor on Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon. There were guitars in his trailer and in his rented house and a lot of time to sit and think. The melancholy yet soaring track “King of Oklahoma” was written there. Isbell also watched the great director work, saw the relationship between a clear vision and its execution, and perhaps most important, saw how even someone as decorated as Scorsese sought out and used his co-workers’ opinions. “It definitely helped when I got into the studio,” Isbell says. “I had this reinvigorated sense of collaboration. You can have an idea and you can execute it and not compromise -- and still listen to the other people in the room.”', 'event_name': 'Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit'}",combined_events,"A Jason Isbell record is a musical masterpiece that captures the essence of his world and resonates with listeners, offering a deep dive into adult themes and personal growth."

Each performance will be followed by a wine and cheese reception in the beautiful Union Trust skylight penthouse. This Could be True , a new one-act by Charles David “Stoney” Richards who also penned last season’s indoor comedy, “Shakespeare: The First Drafts.” Richards says: “ This Could be True is a one-act play about an Actor confined to an insane asylum as he suffers from Misidentification Syndrome and Auditory Hallucinations believing he is a member of Shakespeare’s company. He thinks the people speaking to him are someone else. When he learns of Shakespeare’s death, he becomes further obsessed in getting John Heminges and Henry Condell (who led printing of the First Folio) to publish Will’s plays before ‘they are scattered by the winds of time.’” Richards muses: “I’ve always been impressed by the storytelling talent of William Shakespeare. As a playwright he was a remarkable rewrite artist. He was able to find stories that many people of his day were already familiar with; Hamlet, Henry V and Macbeth, to name a few. He rewrote them with his own sense of drama , responsibility and the conflicts of life, death, love, all subjects that appealed to his audience’s taste. And this came to mind with “ This Could be True.” I think Will was not afraid to ask, ‘What if?’” The two sides battle, but the medical team played by Aaron Crutchfield and Anna Singer believes they have found a way to help the mental torture of this actor, portrayed by playwright Richards). Through the course of this play much is revealed about Shakespeare, the real life character Jon Sincler and the mental maze this illness can create in the human mind. Narrator Harper York asks: “Has this ever happened?” Richards responds that all we can say is “This Could be True!” Actors appearing in THIS COULD BE TRUE:  Charles David “Stoney” Richards returns as both playwright and actor in his own new play. Richards brings his multi-faceted career experience in film, on the air, on stage, and on the page to his second new script for PSiP. Richards has acted in “The Chair,” “The Marksman,” and, again, in “American Rust”, among many film and tv projects. He has portrayed major roles for PSiP including Bottom, Malvolio, Duke of Exeter/Pistol, among others. Read more Aaron Crutchfield returns to PSiP as The Doctor.

Styled as the father of American ballet, he co-founded the New York City Ballet and remained its artistic director for more than 35 years. His choreography is characterized by plotless ballets with minimal costume and décor, performed to classical and neoclassical music. Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, Balanchine took the standards and technique from his time at the Imperial Ballet School and fused it with other schools of movement that he had adopted during his tenure on Broadway and in Hollywood, creating his signature ""neoclassical style”. He was a choreographer known for his musicality; he expressed music with dance and worked extensively with leading composers of his time like Igor Stravinsky. Balanchine was invited to America in 1933 by a young arts patron named Lincoln Kirstein, and together they founded the School of American Ballet in 1934 as well as the New York City Ballet in 1948.

Painted in an Afrofuturist style, Townes’ autobiographical works serve as a rigorous commentary of Black identity, depicting representations that range from being adequately rebellious to thoroughly politically engaged and enraged. Approaching each work through an intuitive art making practice, Townes’ process of layering vibrant colors, glitter, and resin, is meant to mirror the complex nature of Black women's oneness in challenging spaces while investigating the experience of intersectional feminism. By painting directly onto raw wood surfaces, she references the aesthetics and graphic style of street art culture, conveying the sense of its power by figuratively and literally taking up space. By exposing the beauty in raw, and sometimes distressed materials, she calls attention to the act of physical construction and the social construction of unapologetic Black women represented in these works. Artist biography: Kamara Townes, known professionally as Wavy Wednesday, is an artist, muralist and activist based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her work highlights the more playful aspects of her experiences as a Black feminist artist and incorporates elements of pop culture, street art, and Afrofuturism to confront and comment on social, racial, and gender justice. Her multidisciplinary practice, which encompasses painting, sculpture, murals, and installations have been celebrated and featured in several public art projects in the city of Pittsburgh, published in Brian Burley’s “YNGBLKPGH,” and shared widely on popular social media sites including Afropunk and Supermarket Magazine.

TIME Magazine named it one of the “10 Best Non-Fiction Books” of the decade. The New York Times Magazine named Warmth to its list of the best nonfiction books of all time. Her new book, Caste: The Origins of our Discontents, was published in August 2020 to critical acclaim and became a Number 1 New York Times bestseller. Dwight Garner of The New York Times called it, “An instant American classic and almost certainly the keynote nonfiction book of the American century thus far.” Oprah Winfrey chose it as her 2020 Summer/Fall book club selection, declaring it “the most important book” she had ever selected. Wilkerson won the Pulitzer Prize for her deeply humane narrative writing while serving as Chicago Bureau Chief of The New York Times in 1994, making her the first black woman in the history of American journalism to win a Pulitzer Prize and the first African American to win for individual reporting. In 2016, President Barack Obama awarded Wilkerson the National Humanities Medal for “championing the stories of an unsung history.” As the historian Jill Lepore observed in The New Yorker: “What Wilkerson urges, isn’t argument at all; it’s compassion. Hush, and listen.” This series is an ongoing program bringing today’s preeminent speakers and artists to the Center to reflect on current events and share unique and thought-provoking material in hopes of inspiring racial awareness and understanding between people.', 'event_name': 'TRUTHSayers: Isabel Wilkerson'}",combined_events,"TRUTHSayers Speaker Series featuring Isabel Wilkerson, author of ""The Warmth of Other Suns"" and ""Caste,"" at August Wilson African American Cultural Center."
