Fleetwood will discuss how art can heal and humanize in the age of mass incarceration. More than two million people are currently behind bars in the United States. According to Dr. Nicole R. Fleetwood, incarceration not only separates the imprisoned from their families and communities, but it exposes them to deprivation, abuse, and arbitrary cruelties of the criminal justice system. Despite that, many of America’s prisons are filled with art. Despite the isolation and degradation they may experience, the incarcerated are driven to assert their humanity in the face of a system that dehumanizes them. A MacArthur Genius Fellow, curator, art critic, and author of the award-winning “Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration,” Dr. Nicole R. Fleetwood will reveal her unique perspective on how the imprisoned use art to express the visual culture of incarceration and its current impact on contemporary art. Dr. Fleetwood’s lecture will be followed by a Q&A session with the audience and a book signing.  $10 General Admission $5 Members Free for Students with a Valid ID This program will take place in the Mueller Center on the museum’s 5th Floor. Nicole R. Fleetwood is the inaugural James Weldon Johnson Professor of Media, Culture, and Communication in the Steinhardt School at New York University. A MacArthur Fellow, she is a writer, curator, and art critic whose interests are contemporary Black diasporic art and visual culture, photography studies, art and public practice, performance studies, gender and feminist studies, Black cultural history, creative nonfiction, prison abolition and carceral studies, and poverty studies.

Nolan Altman will review an actual case study using headstone inscriptions and will show participants online resources to help find headstone information. Altman will also show examples of headstones and explain what you’re likely to find if you take a trip to the cemetery. He will explain the meaning of symbols that you will find on stones. Even if you can’t read Hebrew, you can understand the inscriptions. He will also show many examples of inscription trends, some odd inscriptions, and errors in inscriptions…even well-known ones.

The selected works highlight depictions from contemporary urban and rural life, to historical events occurring in, and after Yugoslavia, specifically between the 1980s and today, as photography has mirrored the changes in political and ideological systems and their effects on cultural values. However, at the exhibition’s core, is the exploration of documentary practices through artworks that are the results of long-term research, demonstrating how photography can capture and decode the ways in which people perceive, and interact with, changing realities. The work of these Serbian artists and collectives encapsulates Serbia’s transition from a socialist to capitalist state through: personal memories; historical revisionism; the legacy of Yugoslavia’s industrial heritage; a significant period of isolation during the 1990s when Yugoslavia fell apart; and commentary on life in Serbia today. The range of themes provides diverse perspectives on photography, and allows viewers access to Serbia’s complex historical, and rich artistic, narratives – reinforcing the notion that the human landscape is multifaceted, and that all places across the world are in a constant state of transition. The Wind Got Up in the Night and Took Our Plans Away is accompanied by a monthly film program at the Harris Theater showcasing the work of Serbian documentary filmmakers, and a public art installation by the collective Belgrade Raw in Downtown Pittsburgh’s alley, Tito Way.

The works in this exhibition explore varied and combined themes and symbols related to the apollonian and Dionysian, the lunar and solar, the cult of Orpheus, the rights of Mithras, the writings of Toth Hermes Trismegistus, and the cult of Serpais. Brown received his BFA from the Rhode Island School of Design and MFA from the New York Academy of Art. Following graduation, he was awarded the prestigious Eric Fischl residency where he continued to develop his studio practice. Brownâ€™s paintings combine traditional techniques and materials with formal design combining the illusion of representational painting against the reality of the material and the painting as an object. This duality is also seen in the mixing of contemporary and ancient subject matter found in his work where the visual themes often focus on subjects of history, myth, and mortality. Zach actively exhibits throughout the United States having his work covered by Artnet News and Hi-Fructose.

A Jason Isbell record always lands like a decoder ring in the ears and hearts of his audience, a soundtrack to his world and magically to theirs, too. Weathervanes carries the same revelatory power. This is a storyteller at the peak of his craft, observing his fellow wanderers, looking inside and trying to understand, reducing a universe to four minutes. He shrinks life small enough to name the fear and then strip it away, helping his listeners make sense of how two plus two stops equaling four once you reach a certain age -- and carry a certain amount of scars. “There is something about boundaries on this record,” Isbell says. “As you mature, you still attempt to keep the ability to love somebody fully and completely while you’re growing into an adult and learning how to love yourself.” Weathervanes is a collection of grown-up songs: Songs about adult love, about change, about the danger of nostalgia and the interrogation of myths, about cruelty and regret and redemption. Life and death songs played for and by grown ass people. Some will make you cry alone in your car and others will make you sing along with thousands of strangers in a big summer pavilion, united in the great miracle of being alive. The record features the rolling thunder of Isbell’s fearsome 400 Unit, who’ve earned a place in the rock ‘n’ roll cosmos alongside the greatest backing ensembles, as powerful and essential to the storytelling as The E Street Band or the Wailers. They make a big noise, as Isbell puts it, and he feels so comfortable letting them be a main prism through which much of the world hears his art. He can be private but with them behind him he transforms, and there is a version of himself that can only exist in their presence. When he plays a solo show, he is in charge of the entire complicated juggle. On stage with the 400 Unit, he can be a guitar hero when he wants, and a conductor when he wants, and a smiling fan of the majesty of his bandmates when he wants to hang back and listen to the sound. The roots of this record go back into the isolation of the pandemic and to Isbell’s recent time on the set as an actor on Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon. There were guitars in his trailer and in his rented house and a lot of time to sit and think. The melancholy yet soaring track “King of Oklahoma” was written there. Isbell also watched the great director work, saw the relationship between a clear vision and its execution, and perhaps most important, saw how even someone as decorated as Scorsese sought out and used his co-workers’ opinions. “It definitely helped when I got into the studio,” Isbell says. “I had this reinvigorated sense of collaboration. You can have an idea and you can execute it and not compromise -- and still listen to the other people in the room.”'}","A Jason Isbell record is a musical masterpiece that captures the essence of his world and resonates with listeners, offering a deep dive into adult themes and personal growth."

The selected works highlight depictions from contemporary urban and rural life, to historical events occurring in, and after Yugoslavia, specifically between the 1980s and today, as photography has mirrored the changes in political and ideological systems and their effects on cultural values. However, at the exhibition’s core, is the exploration of documentary practices through artworks that are the results of long-term research, demonstrating how photography can capture and decode the ways in which people perceive, and interact with, changing realities. The work of these Serbian artists and collectives encapsulates Serbia’s transition from a socialist to capitalist state through: personal memories; historical revisionism; the legacy of Yugoslavia’s industrial heritage; a significant period of isolation during the 1990s when Yugoslavia fell apart; and commentary on life in Serbia today. The range of themes provides diverse perspectives on photography, and allows viewers access to Serbia’s complex historical, and rich artistic, narratives – reinforcing the notion that the human landscape is multifaceted, and that all places across the world are in a constant state of transition. The Wind Got Up in the Night and Took Our Plans Away is accompanied by a monthly film program at the Harris Theater showcasing the work of Serbian documentary filmmakers, and a public art installation by the collective Belgrade Raw in Downtown Pittsburgh’s alley, Tito Way.

Whether it be shouting the magic words from the comfort of your seats or by coming up on stage to be trained as a magical assistant, every member of your party will actively participate throughout the show. Mr. Messado’s story begins on the TV screen of his grandmother’s Philadelphia living room where global stars like Michael Jackson and David Copperfield ignited a love for entertainment and storytelling. In this deeply personal, hilarious and engaging performance you’ll get to know the mister behind the magic, the rabble-rousing raconteur behind the cape, the magic mentor who is Mr. Messado. This unique family friendly matinee takes place each Sunday at Liberty Magic, our one-of-a-kind intimate speakeasy with only 66 seats in 4 rows, typically reserved only for adults. Mr. Messado’s Magic School for the Young and Young at Heart is recommended for ages 8+. Little brothers and sisters 6 years and older can tag along. No tattletales, snitches, or cheats. Joshua Messado started Messado Magic over 20 years ago at the Houdini’s magic theatre in Atlantic City, NJ. There he found his passion for performing and discovered the linking rings, which is now his signature effect. After Houdini’s, he co-owned a magic shop and theatre in Philadelphia, PA for several years. His career in magic led to national and international television appearances as seen on Wizard Wars with Penn and Teller, SyFy Channel (USA), Temple University TV (USA), Illusions of grandeur, OLN (Canada) and recently on Farid Magic 13, Pro7 (Germany). He’s performed at reputable theatres like the Magic Castle in Hollywood, Chicago Magic Lounge, and Monday Night Magic in New York. He is well equipped with stunning sleight of hand with comedic timing to amaze a wide variety of spectators: corporate shows, college market, resorts, celebrities, adults and children alike. References are ranging from TD Bank, Tropicana Casino to David Copperfield. FAQ: Age Requirements. We have found that kids 5 years of age and under won't understand most of what is happening in this sophisticated magical play, and will probably start to wiggle in their seats because they don't have the attention span to sit and watch""}","A 60-minute family-friendly matinee featuring stunning magic and clean comedy, taught by magician Joshua Messado."

Each performance will be followed by a wine and cheese reception in the beautiful Union Trust skylight penthouse. This Could be True , a new one-act by Charles David “Stoney” Richards who also penned last season’s indoor comedy, “Shakespeare: The First Drafts.” Richards says: “ This Could be True is a one-act play about an Actor confined to an insane asylum as he suffers from Misidentification Syndrome and Auditory Hallucinations believing he is a member of Shakespeare’s company. He thinks the people speaking to him are someone else. When he learns of Shakespeare’s death, he becomes further obsessed in getting John Heminges and Henry Condell (who led printing of the First Folio) to publish Will’s plays before ‘they are scattered by the winds of time.’” Richards muses: “I’ve always been impressed by the storytelling talent of William Shakespeare. As a playwright he was a remarkable rewrite artist. He was able to find stories that many people of his day were already familiar with; Hamlet, Henry V and Macbeth, to name a few. He rewrote them with his own sense of drama , responsibility and the conflicts of life, death, love, all subjects that appealed to his audience’s taste. And this came to mind with “ This Could be True.” I think Will was not afraid to ask, ‘What if?’” The two sides battle, but the medical team played by Aaron Crutchfield and Anna Singer believes they have found a way to help the mental torture of this actor, portrayed by playwright Richards). Through the course of this play much is revealed about Shakespeare, the real life character Jon Sincler and the mental maze this illness can create in the human mind. Narrator Harper York asks: “Has this ever happened?” Richards responds that all we can say is “This Could be True!” Actors appearing in THIS COULD BE TRUE:  Charles David “Stoney” Richards returns as both playwright and actor in his own new play. Richards brings his multi-faceted career experience in film, on the air, on stage, and on the page to his second new script for PSiP. Richards has acted in “The Chair,” “The Marksman,” and, again, in “American Rust”, among many film and tv projects. He has portrayed major roles for PSiP including Bottom, Malvolio, Duke of Exeter/Pistol, among others. Read more Aaron Crutchfield returns to PSiP as The Doctor.

Styled as the father of American ballet, he co-founded the New York City Ballet and remained its artistic director for more than 35 years. His choreography is characterized by plotless ballets with minimal costume and décor, performed to classical and neoclassical music. Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, Balanchine took the standards and technique from his time at the Imperial Ballet School and fused it with other schools of movement that he had adopted during his tenure on Broadway and in Hollywood, creating his signature ""neoclassical style”. He was a choreographer known for his musicality; he expressed music with dance and worked extensively with leading composers of his time like Igor Stravinsky. Balanchine was invited to America in 1933 by a young arts patron named Lincoln Kirstein, and together they founded the School of American Ballet in 1934 as well as the New York City Ballet in 1948. Bob Fosse was an American actor, choreographer, dancer, and film and stage director. He directed and choreographed musical works on stage and screen, including the stage musicals The Pajama Game (1954), Damn Yankees (1955), How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1961), Sweet Charity (1966), Pippin (1972), and Chicago (1975). He directed the films Sweet Charity (1969), Cabaret (1972), Lenny (1975), All That Jazz (1979), and Star 80 (1983). Fosse\'s distinctive style of choreography included turned-in knees and ""jazz hands"". He is the only person ever to have won Oscar, Emmy, and Tony awards in the same year (1973). He was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning Best Director for Cabaret , and won the Palme D\'Or in 1980 for All That Jazz. He won a record eight Tonys for his choreography, as well as one for direction for Pippin . Martha Graham was an American modern dancer and choreographer. Her style, the Graham technique, reshaped American dance and is still taught worldwide. Graham danced and taught for over seventy years. She was the first dancer to perform at the White House, travel abroad as a cultural ambassador, and receive the highest civilian award of the US: the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction. In her lifetime she received honors ranging from the Key to the City of Paris to Japan\'s Imperial Order of the Precious Crown. She said, in the 1994 documentary The Dancer Revealed : ""I have spent all my life with dance and being a dancer. It\'s permitting life to use you in a very intense way. Sometimes it is not pleasant. Sometimes it is fearful. But nevertheless it is inevitable.” Founded in 1926 (the same year as Graham\'s professional dance company), the Martha Graham School is the oldest school of dance in the United States. First located in a small studio within Carnegie Hall, the school currently has two different studios in New York City.

Painted in an Afrofuturist style, Townes’ autobiographical works serve as a rigorous commentary of Black identity, depicting representations that range from being adequately rebellious to thoroughly politically engaged and enraged. Approaching each work through an intuitive art making practice, Townes’ process of layering vibrant colors, glitter, and resin, is meant to mirror the complex nature of Black women's oneness in challenging spaces while investigating the experience of intersectional feminism. By painting directly onto raw wood surfaces, she references the aesthetics and graphic style of street art culture, conveying the sense of its power by figuratively and literally taking up space. By exposing the beauty in raw, and sometimes distressed materials, she calls attention to the act of physical construction and the social construction of unapologetic Black women represented in these works. Artist biography: Kamara Townes, known professionally as Wavy Wednesday, is an artist, muralist and activist based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her work highlights the more playful aspects of her experiences as a Black feminist artist and incorporates elements of pop culture, street art, and Afrofuturism to confront and comment on social, racial, and gender justice. Her multidisciplinary practice, which encompasses painting, sculpture, murals, and installations have been celebrated and featured in several public art projects in the city of Pittsburgh, published in Brian Burley’s “YNGBLKPGH,” and shared widely on popular social media sites including Afropunk and Supermarket Magazine. Townes received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from California University of Pennsylvania and is currently pursuing a Master of Fine Arts degree with a focus in painting at West Virginia University.

Thousands fleeing persecution and expulsions across Western Europe came. As Poland expanded to the east and south, Jews moved into Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian lands. By 1800 there were more than a million Jews in the Pale. By 1900, they would number nearly five million. Jews flourished in the Pale, creating diverse religious, cultural, educational, and charitable institutions. Then, between 1881 and 1914 over two million left all that they had known for the West. This talk discusses how the Pale came to be, life in it and why this mass migration occurred. It breaks the 120-year history of the Pale into periods of creation, confinement, repression, enlightenment, pogroms, and chaos. There is much more to the story than the horrific pogroms at the turn of the 20th century. Additional brief talk, “My 5th Great Grandfather’s Name” The oldest family documentation that I have found is the 1850 Russian Revision List (census) for Dubno which lists my 3rd great-grandfather (who had died in 1848) and my 2nd great-grandfather (who, as a young man, was now head of the family). Unlike censuses, revision lists included information on residents who had died since the previous revision list. Based on the patronymic middle name of my 3rd great-grandfather, I had the name, if nothing more, of my 4th great-grandfather. The records office in Dubno, where the Bookbinders lived, was destroyed during World War II and all records contained there were lost. The regional archive in Rivne has no earlier records. So far as I know, no records exist for my 5th great-grandfather. So, I developed a hypothesis as to his name and the approximate dates of his birth and death. You might use the technique that I employed to do the same when no records can be found. This program is possible through the generous support of the William M.

Painted in an Afrofuturist style, Townes’ autobiographical works serve as a rigorous commentary of Black identity, depicting representations that range from being adequately rebellious to thoroughly politically engaged and enraged. Approaching each work through an intuitive art making practice, Townes’ process of layering vibrant colors, glitter, and resin, is meant to mirror the complex nature of Black women's oneness in challenging spaces while investigating the experience of intersectional feminism. By painting directly onto raw wood surfaces, she references the aesthetics and graphic style of street art culture, conveying the sense of its power by figuratively and literally taking up space. By exposing the beauty in raw, and sometimes distressed materials, she calls attention to the act of physical construction and the social construction of unapologetic Black women represented in these works. Artist biography: Kamara Townes, known professionally as Wavy Wednesday, is an artist, muralist and activist based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her work highlights the more playful aspects of her experiences as a Black feminist artist and incorporates elements of pop culture, street art, and Afrofuturism to confront and comment on social, racial, and gender justice. Her multidisciplinary practice, which encompasses painting, sculpture, murals, and installations have been celebrated and featured in several public art projects in the city of Pittsburgh, published in Brian Burley’s “YNGBLKPGH,” and shared widely on popular social media sites including Afropunk and Supermarket Magazine. Townes received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from California University of Pennsylvania and is currently pursuing a Master of Fine Arts degree with a focus in painting at West Virginia University.

Lacy (Zoe Ziegler), navigating the summer vacation between fifth and sixth grade, yearns to—but also fears to—escape the orbit of her mother Janet (Julianne Nicholson, Mare of Easttown ) as she leaves childhood. It’s been just the two of them, you see, but then three satellites enter, then leave, the picture: Will Patton ( Wendy and Lucy ) as an aspiring boyfriend, Sophie Okonedo ( Hotel Rwanda ) as an old friend, and Elias Koteas ( Exotica ) as the head of a spacey theatre troupe. The screenplay gestated in Baker’s mind and heart for decades—“It was kind of the first idea for a movie I ever had,” she revealed—drawing deeply on the milieu she grew up in, the woods of western Massachusetts. Nicholson did too, though not until they met during casting did the two discover their childhood proximity (“We shopped at the same stores and swam in the same ponds,” Baker said in an interview). No score, just nature sounds, keeps the focus entirely on the mother and daughter in this hyper-subtle character study; sound designer Paul Hsu has said Janet Planet was the quietest movie he’s ever worked on.
