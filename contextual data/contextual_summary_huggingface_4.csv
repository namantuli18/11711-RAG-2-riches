This presentation will familiarize attendees with the evolution of family surnames and the practice of patronymic naming. Recognizing the components of patronymic naming, participants will learn how to take advantage of these clues to link their family through generations. Nolan Altman will review an actual case study using headstone inscriptions and will show participants online resources to help find headstone information. Altman will also show examples of headstones and explain what you’re likely to find if you take a trip to the cemetery. He will explain the meaning of symbols that you will find on stones. Even if you can’t read Hebrew, you can understand the inscriptions. He will also show many examples of inscription trends, some odd inscriptions, and errors in inscriptions…even well-known ones. With a presentation on cemetery records, you wouldn’t expect to leave laughing, but he guarranties you will. This program is possible through the generous support of the William M. Lowenstein Genealogical Research Endowment Fund of the Jewish Community Foundation. “Patronymic Naming and Cemetery Research” is a collaboration between the Jewish Genealogy Society of Pittsburgh and the Rauh Jewish Archives at the Heinz History Center. Please register online. The program is free for JGS-Pittsburgh members and $5 for the general public. To become a member of the JGS-Pittsburgh and receive a free membership code for this program, please visit its website . This program will be recorded and made available to current JGS-Pittsburgh members.  Nolan Altman was bit by the “genealogy bug” when he was inspired to write his family history in 1996 in memory of his mother. After making use of the valuable information on JewishGen , he volunteered to do data entry on various projects. In time, he was asked to become the Coordinator for JewishGen’s Holocaust Database and subsequently the Coordinator for the JOWBR (JewishGen’s Online Worldwide Burial Registry) project. Nolan works with volunteers from around the world helping to grow both databases for the benefit of family members and researchers. Nolan currently holds the position of JewishGen’s Director for Data Acquisition and focuses on growing the JOWBR , Holocaust and Memorial Plaques databases. In 2021, JOWBR won the IAJGS Outstanding Project Award.

A Jason Isbell record always lands like a decoder ring in the ears and hearts of his audience, a soundtrack to his world and magically to theirs, too. Weathervanes carries the same revelatory power. This is a storyteller at the peak of his craft, observing his fellow wanderers, looking inside and trying to understand, reducing a universe to four minutes. He shrinks life small enough to name the fear and then strip it away, helping his listeners make sense of how two plus two stops equaling four once you reach a certain age -- and carry a certain amount of scars. “There is something about boundaries on this record,” Isbell says. “As you mature, you still attempt to keep the ability to love somebody fully and completely while you’re growing into an adult and learning how to love yourself.” Weathervanes is a collection of grown-up songs: Songs about adult love, about change, about the danger of nostalgia and the interrogation of myths, about cruelty and regret and redemption. Life and death songs played for and by grown ass people. Some will make you cry alone in your car and others will make you sing along with thousands of strangers in a big summer pavilion, united in the great miracle of being alive. The record features the rolling thunder of Isbell’s fearsome 400 Unit, who’ve earned a place in the rock ‘n’ roll cosmos alongside the greatest backing ensembles, as powerful and essential to the storytelling as The E Street Band or the Wailers. They make a big noise, as Isbell puts it, and he feels so comfortable letting them be a main prism through which much of the world hears his art. He can be private but with them behind him he transforms, and there is a version of himself that can only exist in their presence. When he plays a solo show, he is in charge of the entire complicated juggle. On stage with the 400 Unit, he can be a guitar hero when he wants, and a conductor when he wants, and a smiling fan of the majesty of his bandmates when he wants to hang back and listen to the sound. The roots of this record go back into the isolation of the pandemic and to Isbell’s recent time on the set as an actor on Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon. There were guitars in his trailer and in his rented house and a lot of time to sit and think. The melancholy yet soaring track “King of Oklahoma” was written there. Isbell also watched the great director work, saw the relationship between a clear vision and its execution, and perhaps most important, saw how even someone as decorated as Scorsese sought out and used his co-workers’ opinions. “It definitely helped when I got into the studio,” Isbell says. “I had this reinvigorated sense of collaboration. You can have an idea and you can execute it and not compromise -- and still listen to the other people in the room.”', 'event_name': 'Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit'}","A Jason Isbell record is a musical masterpiece that captures the essence of his world and resonates with listeners, offering a deep dive into adult themes and personal growth."

Each performance will be followed by a wine and cheese reception in the beautiful Union Trust skylight penthouse. This Could be True , a new one-act by Charles David “Stoney” Richards who also penned last season’s indoor comedy, “Shakespeare: The First Drafts.” Richards says: “ This Could be True is a one-act play about an Actor confined to an insane asylum as he suffers from Misidentification Syndrome and Auditory Hallucinations believing he is a member of Shakespeare’s company. He thinks the people speaking to him are someone else. When he learns of Shakespeare’s death, he becomes further obsessed in getting John Heminges and Henry Condell (who led printing of the First Folio) to publish Will’s plays before ‘they are scattered by the winds of time.’” Richards muses: “I’ve always been impressed by the storytelling talent of William Shakespeare. As a playwright he was a remarkable rewrite artist. He was able to find stories that many people of his day were already familiar with; Hamlet, Henry V and Macbeth, to name a few. He rewrote them with his own sense of drama , responsibility and the conflicts of life, death, love, all subjects that appealed to his audience’s taste. And this came to mind with “ This Could be True.” I think Will was not afraid to ask, ‘What if?’” The two sides battle, but the medical team played by Aaron Crutchfield and Anna Singer believes they have found a way to help the mental torture of this actor, portrayed by playwright Richards). Through the course of this play much is revealed about Shakespeare, the real life character Jon Sincler and the mental maze this illness can create in the human mind. Narrator Harper York asks: “Has this ever happened?” Richards responds that all we can say is “This Could be True!” Actors appearing in THIS COULD BE TRUE:  Charles David “Stoney” Richards returns as both playwright and actor in his own new play. Richards brings his multi-faceted career experience in film, on the air, on stage, and on the page to his second new script for PSiP. Richards has acted in “The Chair,” “The Marksman,” and, again, in “American Rust”, among many film and tv projects. He has portrayed major roles for PSiP including Bottom, Malvolio, Duke of Exeter/Pistol, among others. Read more Aaron Crutchfield returns to PSiP as The Doctor.

Styled as the father of American ballet, he co-founded the New York City Ballet and remained its artistic director for more than 35 years. His choreography is characterized by plotless ballets with minimal costume and décor, performed to classical and neoclassical music. Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, Balanchine took the standards and technique from his time at the Imperial Ballet School and fused it with other schools of movement that he had adopted during his tenure on Broadway and in Hollywood, creating his signature ""neoclassical style”. He was a choreographer known for his musicality; he expressed music with dance and worked extensively with leading composers of his time like Igor Stravinsky. Balanchine was invited to America in 1933 by a young arts patron named Lincoln Kirstein, and together they founded the School of American Ballet in 1934 as well as the New York City Ballet in 1948. Bob Fosse was an American actor, choreographer, dancer, and film and stage director. He directed and choreographed musical works on stage and screen, including the stage musicals The Pajama Game (1954), Damn Yankees (1955), How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1961), Sweet Charity (1966), Pippin (1972), and Chicago (1975). He directed the films Sweet Charity (1969), Cabaret (1972), Lenny (1975), All That Jazz (1979), and Star 80 (1983). Fosse\'s distinctive style of choreography included turned-in knees and ""jazz hands"". He is the only person ever to have won Oscar, Emmy, and Tony awards in the same year (1973). He was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning Best Director for Cabaret , and won the Palme D\'Or in 1980 for All That Jazz. He won a record eight Tonys for his choreography, as well as one for direction for Pippin . Martha Graham was an American modern dancer and choreographer. Her style, the Graham technique, reshaped American dance and is still taught worldwide. Graham danced and taught for over seventy years. She was the first dancer to perform at the White House, travel abroad as a cultural ambassador, and receive the highest civilian award of the US: the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction. In her lifetime she received honors ranging from the Key to the City of Paris to Japan\'s Imperial Order of the Precious Crown. She said, in the 1994 documentary The Dancer Revealed : ""I have spent all my life with dance and being a dancer. It\'s permitting life to use you in a very intense way. Sometimes it is not pleasant. Sometimes it is fearful. But nevertheless it is inevitable.” Founded in 1926 (the same year as Graham\'s professional dance company), the Martha Graham School is the oldest school of dance in the United States.

TIME Magazine named it one of the “10 Best Non-Fiction Books” of the decade. The New York Times Magazine named Warmth to its list of the best nonfiction books of all time. Her new book, Caste: The Origins of our Discontents, was published in August 2020 to critical acclaim and became a Number 1 New York Times bestseller. Dwight Garner of The New York Times called it, “An instant American classic and almost certainly the keynote nonfiction book of the American century thus far.” Oprah Winfrey chose it as her 2020 Summer/Fall book club selection, declaring it “the most important book” she had ever selected. Wilkerson won the Pulitzer Prize for her deeply humane narrative writing while serving as Chicago Bureau Chief of The New York Times in 1994, making her the first black woman in the history of American journalism to win a Pulitzer Prize and the first African American to win for individual reporting. In 2016, President Barack Obama awarded Wilkerson the National Humanities Medal for “championing the stories of an unsung history.” As the historian Jill Lepore observed in The New Yorker: “What Wilkerson urges, isn’t argument at all; it’s compassion.

Thousands fleeing persecution and expulsions across Western Europe came. As Poland expanded to the east and south, Jews moved into Lithuanian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian lands. By 1800 there were more than a million Jews in the Pale. By 1900, they would number nearly five million. Jews flourished in the Pale, creating diverse religious, cultural, educational, and charitable institutions. Then, between 1881 and 1914 over two million left all that they had known for the West. This talk discusses how the Pale came to be, life in it and why this mass migration occurred. It breaks the 120-year history of the Pale into periods of creation, confinement, repression, enlightenment, pogroms, and chaos. There is much more to the story than the horrific pogroms at the turn of the 20th century. Additional brief talk, “My 5th Great Grandfather’s Name” The oldest family documentation that I have found is the 1850 Russian Revision List (census) for Dubno which lists my 3rd great-grandfather (who had died in 1848) and my 2nd great-grandfather (who, as a young man, was now head of the family). Unlike censuses, revision lists included information on residents who had died since the previous revision list. Based on the patronymic middle name of my 3rd great-grandfather, I had the name, if nothing more, of my 4th great-grandfather. The records office in Dubno, where the Bookbinders lived, was destroyed during World War II and all records contained there were lost. The regional archive in Rivne has no earlier records. So far as I know, no records exist for my 5th great-grandfather. So, I developed a hypothesis as to his name and the approximate dates of his birth and death. You might use the technique that I employed to do the same when no records can be found. This program is possible through the generous support of the William M. Lowenstein Genealogical Research Endowment Fund of the Jewish Community Foundation. “Why did our Jewish ancestors leave the Pale?” is a collaboration between the Jewish Genealogy Society of Pittsburgh and the Rauh Jewish Archives at the Heinz History Center.

Workers from field to country unite to form volunteer Guerrilla armies to face the ruthless Black and Tan squads, who are blocking Ireland’s bid for Independence. Driven by a deep sense of duty and a love for his country, Damien O’Sullivan (Cillian Murphy, who recently won an Oscar for his performance in OPPENHEIMER), abandons his burgeoning career as a doctor and joins his brother, Teddy (Padraic Delaney), and committed trade unionist Dan (Liam Cunningham) in a dangerous and violent fight for Ireland’s freedom. As the freedom fighters’ bold tactics bring the British to breaking point, both sides finally agree to a treaty to end the bloodshed. But, despite the apparent victory, civil war erupts and families, who fought side by side, find themselves pitted against one another as sworn enemies, putting their loyalties to the ultimate test. In this film Loach offers a powerful cinematic vision of Irish history, which focuses on questions of nation and revolution through the eyes of a community; and the film’s tale remains highly resonant throughout the world today.

Shot in 1967 with a miniscule budget, a novice’s faith, a wild passion, and with over 60 of Greene’s CMU School of Drama classmates, this meandering narrative reflects a moment in time and place of bohemian youth without real purpose other than scoring enough cash for their next party.', 'category': 'Entertainment,, Film & Movies', 'venue': 'Harris Theater 809 Liberty Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15222', 'more_details': 'As Greene describes it, the film follows “three young men living together in poverty in a run down section of a large city, where life stands still as it does nowhere short of prison.” Terry Riebling plays Cal Thacker, an aspiring artist reeling from the break-up of a relationship, who seeks oblivion in booze, crashes his motorcycle, and rages at his roommates. Come Back Baby was shot in the shadow of Forbes Field and the movie unfolds across a recognizable Pittsburgh landscape. Events primarily take place in and around a South Bouquet St. apartment and include numerous street scenes where the stadium and other city landmarks feature prominently. This is a distinctively Pittsburgh film, and it was selected by Jonas Mekas for national exhibition via Filmmakers Distribution Center. Yet the movie failed to make a lasting impression upon limited release in 1968. Aside from a smattering of TV screenings over the subsequent decade, it has been completely unavailable. Now the only known 16mm print has been digitally scanned, and, for the first time in many decades, Come Back Baby returns. P David Greene and film historian Michael Prosser will join us for discussion of the film after the screening.

Of outstanding interest is our observation that in humans such survival response is mounted following “slow” but not “fast” (traumatic) death. Our work helps understand the ways in which cells and tissues, and the genes in them, strive for life even as the body dies. About Chandan K. Sen Dr. Chandan K. Sen, PhD, MS, is a distinguished figure in regenerative medicine and wound care technology. He is an elected Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors. Dr. Sen is a University Endowed Professor of Surgery and directs the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. He also serves as the Associate Vice Chancellor for Life Sciences Innovation and Commercialization at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Sen’s leadership focuses on advancing health care research vital to Pittsburgh’s future, fostering collaborations with local and national partners, and facilitating the translation of scientific discoveries into practical applications for patients. The emergent field of regenerative medicine has been assigned separate RMAT designation by the US FDA. This multibillion healthcare market is set to rise sharply and Dr. Sen’s efforts are directed at establishing Pittsburgh as a key leader in this new domain. With a career spanning over two decades, Dr. Sen’s research has been instrumental in developing innovative solutions for tissue injury, regeneration, and infection management.

The presentation will include online sources and documents not yet online for both the United States and Europe; she will also cover some basic knowledge critical to researching one’s Jewish roots. 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. Break (no lunch provided) Second Session 1 p.m.-3 p.m. “Defying Expectations: The Story of a Jewish Woman Who Took on the Russian Empire.” Chava Lefand (1797-1884) lived in a time when we’d expect a woman to not be well-represented in documentation. And in fact, looking at traditional genealogical documents gives little information about Chava and the life she lived. But Chava’s story shows how much can be learned by looking at non-traditional documentation to learn about an individual and the context in which they lived. Chava had already lost two children to mandatory conscription into the Russian Empire, and she refused to lose another. The widowed mother filed a series of petitions throughout the 1850s which went as high as two Czars and the Governing Senate (the Russian Empire’s Supreme Court equivalent). In doing this, she generated a genealogical gold mine (telling of secret marriages and here various relatives were living or hiding from the draft) and gave her perspective on family and community gossip and conflict. While this is the talk about one woman (the speaker’s 5th great grandmother), her hundreds of pages of petitions and appeals tell her perspective of how Jewish families dealt with mandatory conscription of their young children, how conscription caused strife within the Jewish community and formed a hierarchy (she felt she wasn’t part of the cool kids’ clique), and how relatively simple Jewish families were able to generate a significant amount of documentation in the mid-1800s. This program is possible through the generous support of the William M. Lowenstein Genealogical Research Endowment Fund of the Jewish Community Foundation. “Jewish Genealogy Day” is a collaboration between the Jewish Genealogy Society of Pittsburgh and the Rauh Jewish Archives at the Heinz History Center. Please register online. The program is free for JGS-Pittsburgh members. Non-members can attend one session for $10 or both session for $18, which includes a free one-year membership to the JGS. To become a member of the JGS-Pittsburgh and receive a free membership code for this program, please visit its website . This program will be recorded and made available to current JGS-Pittsburgh members.  Lara Diamond began researching her own family around 1989. She has traced all branches of her family multiple generations back in Eastern Europe using Russian Empire-era and Austria-Hungarian Empire records. Most of her personal research is in modern-day Ukraine, with a smattering of Belarus and Poland. She has done client research leading to their ancestors in many parts of the former USSR, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and more. She is president of the Jewish Genealogy Society of Maryland and is JewishGen’s Subcarpathia Research Director. She has lectured around the country and internationally on Jewish and Eastern European genealogy research as well as genetic genealogy. She also runs multiple district- and town-focused projects to collect documentation to assist all those researching ancestors from common towns.

Having spent last spring and early summer with his taking-it-to-the-roots I Go Back 2023 Tour of those arenas and markets where he rose to major headlining status, the only country artist to be on Billboard ’s Top 10 Touring Artists of the Last 25 Years for the past 14 years is bringing old friends and new to 18 full-scale stadiums with a few more major surprises to come. Joining Chesney is the multiple GRAMMY-winning Zac Brown Band , enjoying their 12th CMA Group of the Year nomination; 2023 CMA Song of the Year and New Artist nominee Megan Moroney ; and multiple-week No. 1 “When The Sun Goes Down” duet partner Uncle Kracker , known for his own hits “Follow Me” and “Drift Away.” “I wanted a name that suggested – obviously – when all the good stuff starts to happen. The one thing I’ve learned about No Shoes Nation and these stadium shows is they start the good times early and they just keep it going,” Chesney says of his 2024 tour name. “But we all know, when the sun goes down, that’s when people really get loose and enjoy themselves. “That was the thing about Kracker and my song. It captured a vibe and a moment so perfectly. No matter how much fun you’re having all day long, ‘ everything gets hotter when the sun goes down...’ I know from years of experience that’s true. “So, I can’t wait to get back out there, stadium-sized ’cause there’s nothing like 60,000 members of No Shoes Nation singing these songs. It’s gonna be awesome.” Kicking off April 20, 2024 at Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium, the tour will run through August 23 at Foxborough, Mass.’s Gillette Stadium for what has become a tradition: closing out the tour in a venue Chesney has played to well over a million people. Tickets for these major stadium shows will go on-sale next Friday, Nov. 17. “Zac Brown Band understands high-energy country, the same way Alabama did, and they’ve got our friend Caroline Jones in their line-up now, too,” Chesney says of the group joining as direct support. “Megan Moroney isn’t just one of the smart new voices in country, she’s really bringing a sense of heart and joy to the music – and I’m fired up to be bringing her out to No Shoes Nation. “And Uncle Kracker has been part of so many fun times, crazy moments and memories made, it always kicks things up a notch when he’s out there with us. So, it really is old friends, new friends and a whole lotta love.” Again presented by Blue Chair Bay® Rum, the Sun Goes Down 2024 Tour brings all the high velocity energy and songs people know by heart back to America’s favorite stadiums.

See 3 or more Capra films (including the documentary) and recieve a discount, AND free popcorn at each of the screenings! Made during the Great Depression and just before World War II, this sharp-edged comedy marked a turning point for director Frank Capra from optimism to a more ambivalent vision. It celebrates democracy and the difference one determined man can make (decades before the “deep state” entered the parlance), but depicts a Washington so deeply compromised by vested interests that some feared the film might be used as fascist propaganda. In fact, it was banned in Nazi Germany. Mr Smith Goes to Washington belongs to James Stewart as the goofy, stuttering dreamer. The role, originally intended for Gary Cooper, made him a star. Claude Rains also impresses as a politician who has abdicated his youthful ideals, while Jean Arthur is memorable as Stewart’s savvy, cynical Girl Friday. From special appointments to legislative proceedings, the 1939 film was one of the first films preserved by the Library of Congress because it was considered so “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.” Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, it only won one as it faced-off against Gone with the Wind , The Wizard of Oz and Goodbye, Mr Chips .
