        "content": "I recommend reading the entire article as it’s pretty great but I want to highlight some parts:\n\n“He’s so welcoming. It’s honestly crazy how he’s a better person than he is a player given how outstanding he is as a player,” prospect Jonathan Gruden said. “But he’s just an unbelievable person who makes you feel like you’ve been here 18, 20 years along with [Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang]. It’s incredible.”\n\n(…)\n\nFor Crosby, being a captain is “first and foremost” about leading by example, with strong habits on and off the ice preparing him for the biggest of moments.\n\nBroz and other prospects observed that as they watched him closely in camp.\n\n“He does every drill like it’s Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final,” marveled Broz.\n\nBut just as striking to these fledgling Penguins has been seeing how Crosby goes out of his way to make every one of them feel like part of the team.\n\n(…)\n\nCrosby sat back at his locker stall at the practice rink the other day, flecks of gray peeking through his black hair and sweat dripping off his chin, as he thoughtfully discussed his leadership style and getting through to Generation Z. For example, McGroarty was literally in diapers when Crosby made his debut.\n\n“I try to put myself in their shoes, but obviously things change. They evolve,” Crosby said. “I think the biggest thing as a rookie is just all the unknowns. You’re in a new league, new team, new teammates, new city. Everything is new. The faster you feel comfortable, that’s a huge part of being able to be at your best.”\n\n(…)\n\nFrom there, Crosby explained, it just comes down to listening and observing. And he believes all of this applies to every player, not just prospects coming in.\n\n“I think that’s just part of being on a team. I enjoy that,” he said. “There are so many different personalities and everybody comes from different places. To me, that’s the cool part about playing the game, is you get everybody together, get everybody on the same page and you find a way to have success.”",

        "content": "\"Sam has made a lot of strides in his time with the Penguins. The biggest thing is just understanding what his own personal identity is as a player and how he's going to carve a niche in making an NHL roster and becoming an NHL player. Every young player, when they turn pro, they go through this identity process where some players have to adapt.\n\n\"So, if you're playing in college hockey or you're playing junior hockey and you're a point-per-game (player) or you're the go-to guy on the power play, that might not be the case when you get to the next level. So, if that's not the case, then what is your competitive advantage? What is it that you're bringing to the table that is going to help a team win? What's your contribution to that identity?\n\n\"Those are some of the conversations we've had with Sam. Just continuing to work on his overall two-way game, his play away from the puck, his play within structure, knowing positional play and things of that nature and the details around that are really important. Because if you're not scoring 40 goals and 100 points, then you need to be a guy that's reliable and trustworthy and predictable for your teammates. That's something that I think is an area of opportunity for growth for Sam.\n\n\"He's very capable and he is obviously a talented player. It's more just trying to understand how his own personal game needs to adapt or evolve so he has a skillset that is complimentary to the group and gives him the opportunity to carve a roster spot. It's not so much scoring his way onto this roster. It's being a reliable player and the details around that, it's a lot of the thankless jobs that maybe go unnoticed. That's the foundation of how players, in my experience, enter the league. That gives him the ability to act on his talent and his instincts ... and his game can evolve.\n\n\"Sam is going through that process like most young players go through that process. I don't think he's any different in that regard. We're every bit as encouraged by Sam's game as we've always been. Once again, players evolve at different rates. Some guys take a little bit longer to find their game than others. Sam is going through that process. He's a talented guy. We think so highly of him and we believe that he's a guy that could potentially help this team moving forward.\"",

Always one of the most noticeable guys on the ice, he dominated puck battles in the corners.  We kind of saw that coming, but I'm not sure anyone  projected how smooth and fleetfooted he looks this season.  A totally different guy on the ice than where he was 10 months ago - hell even 6 months ago. \n\nGood on Puusty for finding some twine on a play in tight (Koivunen with the feed and a decent game too).  However, the winner of this preseason for the Penguins is clear.  Congrats to the big guy.  Here's hoping he can keep it rolling\\*.\n\n\\*this is where my big concern for him comes  - he's never played more than 65 games in a season.  Maybe that just leaves oppo for some others.",

        "content": "On the importance of adding an element of versatility through penalty-killing: \"When you look at how forwards enter this league, most forwards enter this league through the bottom-six. In other words, it's really hard for an eighteen, a nineteen, a twenty-year-old to come into the NHL and play in the top-six. It's a very good league, and there's a lot of really good players... so part of the roles that are cast with those guys is your ability to be reliable defensively. I think to have those elements of versatility in your game is only a strength, it can only help a player, any player that's trying to enter the league, because it gives us the ability to utilize those players in different roles. I think that's why it's important for players like Rutger or young players that are trying to establish themselves in the league to be part of those situations. We wanted to see how he would handle it, and I think he's done a really good job.\"\n\nFrom DKSP (no link, as they are not allowed), on McGroarty's speed: \"We talk about playing the game fast, and speed manifests itself in a number of different ways. It's not just physical foot speed. There are guys that can play a speed game because they can think it. Their anticipation skills, their recognition skills, things of that nature are really good, and so they have the capacity to play a fast game. When you look at the evolution of the NHL and how today's game is being played, I think the modern NHL is all about speed... I think Rutger's a guy that can think it really well. He has good anticipation skills, he has great recognition skills, he has the ability to change the point of attack because he sees it pretty good, he moves the puck well. That's what we've seen in his game.\"",

Maybe they're just rotating a lot of guys every other night, but one would think he needs as many more opportunities as possible.  Poolparty is similarly out tonight. \n\nThe only players on the forward group from last night are Rutger McGroarty and Vasily Ponomarev.  I find that somewhat compelling.  The coaches want to see how these guys look with each of the groups. \n\nObviously, tonights group, aside from Gruden, Koivunen, and Kopanen, are otherwise the forward group who will play against the Rags on the 9th.  So, I dunno, maybe nothing to it... maybe something. \n\nMy best guess right now, in light of last night is that we go into the season with 8 defensemen and 13 forwards.   The top 6 is set DOC-Sid-Rust, Bunting-Geno-Rak. 3rd Beauv-Eller-Glass, 4th Lizotte I think is the only 100% lock.  Then you have: Acciari/Hayes, Ponomarev/Poolparty.  To me this is the competition remaining.  \n\nThe thing that sucks is the guy I want to see the most is the one that's waivers exempt - Pono.  From everything I've  seen from Sully & this franchise in the past, they send down the exempt guy if it's even close.",

You know, I when you look at the the nature of the the way that game was played and the caliber of talent that was on both sides, it was an NHL game.

You know, they came at us pretty hard in the 1st period.\n\nI didn't think we had a great start, but I thought we got a whole lot better, once we responded and we had some pushback. But maybe the most encouraging part of it was, the young players like Pick and Harry Burnicke. I thought, they played through that extremely well. \n\nThat's an environment as a young player that you could easily be intimidated, and, and they showed zero sign of it. They they went back for pucks. They were undeterred. They took hits to make plays. They made some real nice subtle plays, to beat pressure, taking hits to do so. I thought they I thought they played through it extremely well.

The rest of our line just stood there, but not Boko, who immediately rushes in and starts peeling off bodies. I *really* feel like the Pens are missing this type of player lately.\n\nSure, the NHL has changed and you don't really *need* an enforcer anymore, but let's be honest...the Pens have been kinda soff the past couple years, and I think the best teams still have someone that make the other team think twice about taking liberties. Boko definitely fits the bill, plus he actually has some legs for such a big dude, and seems pretty responsible with the puck. I really wouldn't be upset to see him on the roster, even if he's a healthy scratch on nights that aren't likely to get chippy.\n\nAnyone else feel the same way?

Again, barring injury or someone really doing something to earn a spot (Poolparty seems to be earning in practice and exhibition).\n\nI also note that top line for the AHL Group.  I see this as the top group at the AHL level to start this season, and it is reminiscent of our top AHL grou in 2015, and I think we remember them and what they did, right?   Sheary, Rust, Sheary, Sundqvist, Kuhnakl, Wilson, even Dom Simon...\n\nFor the first time since that 2015 season, we have players starting the season in the AHL who could be real contributors at the NHL level this season.  That's a good thing for an organization.\n\nSo, feel pity for Puusty, McG, Pono, Broz, & Koivunen if you must, but I wouldn't hate it if that group had a similar push, effect, and swift graduation.\n\nPens opening night roster in 2015 had Beau Bennet, Farnham, Perron, Plotnikov, Scuds, and Sprong on it.  We got smoked 3-0 by Dallas.\n\nPens playoffs game 1 roster that same year:   Sheary, Kunkackl, Sundqvist, up from AHL. Rust wasn't on that nights roster but had logged 41 regular season games, and played in every playoff game moving forward.",

Now I come from a family of football fans but no one really watches hockey. \n\nSo should I just, stop worrying and enjoy this fresh new feeling?

We look forward to being a part of it far beyond this single post. \n\nHave you ever found yourself watching your favorite hockey player and thinking, “wow, I wish I could do that”? Well, do we have good news for you! In the Victory Hockey League (VHL) you have the opportunity to create your very own ice-hockey player.\n\nFor over 17 years, the VHL has offered people the chance to create, train, and manage their very own professional ice hockey player. As a forum-based hockey league, users can earn weekly ability points (TPE) either with a couple of easy clicks or by writing stories, creating graphics, and even producing podcasts. All of which can add to the story of your player. Once you’ve earned these points you can apply them to your player. Want to be a playmaker? Load up on passing! Do you want to drive to the net with the puck on a string? Increase your Stick Handling and Deking. It's your player, your career, your choice.\n\nOne of the greatest parts of the VHL is that we are a diverse community of hockey fans who share a common interest in building players, creating stories, and watching our very own players make it to the Hall of Fame. As a user, you also have the chance to manage a team, create lines, negotiate contracts, and much more.\n\nAll of our games are run through the Simon T Hockey Simulator, and when the season is in full swing you can expect daily simulations, some chirping, and a lot of fun. Watch as your player grows from being someone no one knows in the Victory Hockey League Minors, to a rising star in the Victory Hockey League Europe, and finally a superstar in the Victory Hockey League.\n\nNo matter what, even if you just want to check us out, we have a great community of people who will help you learn, answer your questions, and may even become some of your greatest friends.\n\nTo find out more join our Discord server: [https://discord.gg/RYvexVB4](https://discord.gg/RYvexVB4) and visit our website, [https://vhlforum.com/](https://vhlforum.com/) and [https://vhlportal.com/](https://vhlportal.com/)",

        "title": "Potential Inspiration for Rutger Deciding To Leave Winnipeg",
        "content": "I don't know if it's just my micro-obsession with hockey or perhaps the sunk cost fallacy from following Brayden Yager so closely over the last year and a half (seriously, I watched the WHL playoffs in 360p for nothing), but I've been consuming a lot of media on Rutger McGroarty over the past 72 hours. I feel like I may have stumbled across the catalyst for Rutger deciding to call his own shot regarding where he begins his NHL career.\n\nSo, I don’t usually watch Daily Faceoff but I found an [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikkZZm7R7tI&t=3304s) of *Morning Cuppa Hockey* featuring Rutger McGroarty fresh off his gold medal win at the WJC. The irony of this episode is that there's a 30-minute cold open with Frank Seravalli, prior to Rutger joining the show, discussing his teammate and alternate captain of the WJC USA team, Cutter Gauthier, who decided not to sign with the Philadelphia Flyers and who was ultimately traded.\n\nWhat’s particularly interesting about this interview is that one of the co-hosts, Colby Cohen, used to play for Rutger's dad in the USHL. Cohen has hinted in this interview and others that he has known Rutger since he was a kid and still talks to him personally in some capacity. Whether or not he was involved in Rutger’s decision-making is purely speculative, but a lot of the discourse shared during this episode and later on was... intriguing.\n\nFrank Seravalli had an interesting take in this episode on players calling the shots, similar to NBA players:\n\n>*\"I actually like that, by the way. Players have control. They have a voice. If you don't want to play, use your voice. Get to where you want to get to. That's the deal. You're put in a lottery situation where the fate of your career is in the hands of someone else. You say, 'you know what, I don't want to go to the place where I was drafted. Who says I have to?' When you're a college player especially, you have a 4-year clock. The Flyers had until 2026, essentially, to wait this out. I have no issue with players using their voice to get to where they want. That's how life should be.\"*\n\nColby Cohen in a later episode/clip after Rutger decided he wanted to leave Winnipeg:\n\n>*\"Does the NHL need to change the rules to force players to sign with teams that draft them? Absolutely not. Think of the leverage teams have every day. They make an offer, you don't like it, they say okay bye. They don't like the way you play, they send you to the minors. How about all the draft picks that NHL teams don't offer a contract to? That happens every year as well. So I understand as a fan you get upset when these things happen, but you've got to remember something: teams exercise their leverage every day. Players are allowed to do the same thing. We see it in every sport and every player, young and old. Players that have leverage should be able to exercise their leverage because teams do the exact same thing in every single situation. Teams guilt you into things. They hold things over your head. They do kind of shady, dirty stuff behind the scenes all the time. A lot of it never makes it out publicly, so just understand that when you're kind of looking at this situation and you want to be very angry at a 21-year-old kid.\"*",

In fact, I still think that it's quite possible he will be dealt before the season begins. He would be a fantastic 4C on a Stanley cup contender.  Pens have the ability to retain some of his cheap 2.45, and could send him as a league minimum cap hit, in exchange for a pick (I'd like to replace that 2nd for 2025).\n\nI also cannot imagine a scenario in which Rakell lasts the season. I'm betting they staple him to Bunting Malkin right up to the trade deadline to pump those numbers, hell if it's not going well, I'd give him 1st team PP, to pump those numbers. \n\nRust cannot be moved this season, he has a full NMC.  He's here at least until the end of the league year. \n\nPotential 2025-26 lineup:\n\n10-87-Yager\n\n8-71-Koivunen\n\nPonomarev-Glass-48\n\n46-13 - Broz\n\nThat's just how quickly, this can become one of the youngest lineups in the league, with a good volume of draft picks.

Instead, they’re just getting third/forth line players on one year deals hoping for a miracle chance that somebody breaks out all the while collecting a few 2nds and 3rds in future years 26, 27, etc. This just seems like a bad idea. Instead of getting one big name forward with their cap space they got players like Glass, Hayes, Lizotte, and Beauvillier. Now the younger players really don’t have a shot at the big leagues since there’s a huge logjam of bottom tier players and the big league roster doesn’t have the juice necessary to be competitive against other teams. We’re stuck in the middle. The way to actually do this would’ve been to sign one big caliber forward and let the existing youth come up and give it a shot. Their production on the 3rd/4th would’ve been better than these guys mentioned above. Dubas is cooking but he’s cooking shit.",

        "title": "Revisiting the Erik Karlsson Trade One Year Later: a tale of two offseasons",
        "content": "Three hundred and sixty-six days ago the Penguins made a blockbuster trade that had the attention of the entire national hockey league and the fanbase of all 32 teams, when it sent a 2024 1st round pick, a 2025 2nd round pick, Mikael Granlund, Jan Rutta, Casey DeSmith, and Jeff Petry out the door to San Jose and Montreal.\n\nThe first round pick ended up with Buffalo, and turned into Konsta Helenius.  While I am not making a prediction about his future, I think he shows good value and was not some sort of oddity here.  There was also a 2025 2nd rounder, which is going to 46 overall going to the Habs. The other pieces that came back in the direction of Pittsburgh have been shuffled off, and the result is getting rid of 4 troubling players and bringing in one defensive superstar.  \n\nSo, one year later, how do we feel about the trade?  My gut reaction is that in a vacuum, I'm still very pleased with this trade.  We had 4 pieces that we really needed to move, and that no one wanted.  3 of them were on awful contracts:  2 seasons of washed Petry at 6.25; 2 x 2.75 for an even more washed Rutta; and an inexplicable 2 more years at 5 mil for Granlund.  (other cap details, Pens retain 1.56 on Petry, SJ 1.5 on Karlsson).  There was no possible way to move those players, even for future considerations without giving away some picks.  However, giving away a first is interesting in light of this very different offseason. \n\nRegardless, Karlsson was good to great with some very Karlsson moments last season.  I would expect him to be even more comfortable and effective this season.  Given that, I cannot say this deal was not an effective way of improving the team.  Those 4 subtractions without addition would have been a boost, but we also added a great offensive defensemen.  \n\nWhat does make this trade look the most suspect however, is the quick about face Kyle Dubas has done from last season to this one.  Last offseason, the message was clear - he was reloading, reshaping this team, and trading away 1st rounders to win now. Then trading a 3rd rounder to get a consistent scorer for the top 6 (in Smith, who just did not work out).  This offseason, the message that Kyle gives in press conferences is similar, but his actions speak volumes.  He is not willing to move any picks for any players.  Several young RFAs were openly making it known that they wanted out.  But no picks were parted with for even elite young players.  Now, we don't know what could have been offered, but we have not heard a peep about any attempted signing other than Tarasenko, to whom we allegedly made a slightly worse offer than the one he accepted.  Trade rumors involving the team have been non-existent. \n\nInstead, this offseason, Kyle is willing to take on absolutely washed players - the kind he spent picks to get rid of just last year, if he can get a pick with them.  Kevin Hayes has been effectively cut by two bad NHL teams in a row.  First, Philly dumped him, retaining 50% of his salary (3.5), then he was so bad last season that even at half his salary St. Louis needed him gone. His adv stats were all declining. His movement was greatly declining. Doug Armstrong's statement spoke volumes:  \"This is just a situation where it wasn't working,\" the Blues GM said. \"I made a decision a year ago that I thought it could work for three years, and as the year progressed, it didn't look like it was working for either side. But when you put it down on paper, it wasn't a shining moment for myself.\"\n\nSo, a team that desperately needs to get younger, who's star players Side & Geno have publicly spoken out saying we need more young fast players injected into this roster, is instead letting what are likely the last two season of Geno's NHL career be thrown down the toilet for a super slow, half committed rebuild.  The team just got older and slower, in exchange for a 2nd round pick (17% chance of being an NHL player).  That's the move of an overt rebuild, particularly after the very sound trade of Jake Guentzel for viable prospects and a legitimate player in his late 20s. \n\nThat's what I find curious and curiouser about the two offseasons.  The message being delivered from Dubas is consistent, but the actions taken are diametrically opposed.  One season adding a $10 million superstar with term in exchange for picks, adding a $5million contract for a scorer for a 3rd round pick, then the next taking player/cap dumps for picks, and adding a 1 year contract on a 30 year old Dman in need of a career turnaround, and retaining salary on Smith for picks. Those things all scream full rebuild in progress.\n\nAnyway, that's it - just two very different offseasons by action, while the team and Kyle oddly refuse to admit what they're doing.  What's everyone's temperature on the Karlsson trade a year out?  Would you do it again, knowing what you know a year later?   Would it have been better to keep those picks, play out last season and those contracts.  Try to move Granlund without giving up as much?  Does any of this have anything to do with Sid's contract not being extended yet?  \n\ntldr: this post is as long as A Tale of Two Cities, what do you think about the Karlsson trade a year later, and in light of the change in direction between the two offseasons?",

The comeback game. I was in the building, the place was as loud as I had ever heard it (it was only the second season of the new arena at the time), and the crowd was just waiting for Sid to do something special. And do something special he did.\n\nAs soon as he picked the puck up and starting flying up the ice like only he can, I had never been so sure that someone was going to score. And did he ever. As soon as he scored here, screamed “FUCK YEAH” at the top of his lungs, you knew the old Crosby from before the injuries was immediately back. Sid has so many goals that could be picked as a favorite, but I come back to this one just because of how impactful it was in the comeback game, and obviously just a gorgeous goal\n\nHappy Birthday 87, pls announce that extension today 🙏",

Iceburgh has a yellow beak, and I think that would probably look better realized in 3d.\n\nOh, just thought that 3d printing would be a great option!

        "content": "So by now, everyone has heard the rumors about Nick Robertson demanding a trade out of Toronto, and the obvious connection to the Penguins current GM and the Director of player personnel, who drafted him in 2019.\n\nKeep in mind, much like the Pens, the Leafs have been lacking in 1st rounders due to trades, and Robertson, taken at #53 overall was their first selection that year.  Obviously Kyle and Wes thought highly of him.  Rightfully so, he was better than a point per game for the Petes leading into the draft, and then after being taken crushed as a 19 year old with 86 points in the O.  \n\nLast year he got 56 games, which isn't terrible, but they were short on minutes and quality.  He got about 11 minutes per gamee, and still managed 14 goals - which would have put him 8th on the Pens in scoring. Compare him to Puusty, who had 52 games, 11:45 a night, got opportunities to pop into the top 6, and got 5 goals on the year.\n\nSo, of course he's a good young player, the questions are:  what does it cost to get him?  what should this team spend. \n\nI'm of the opinion that you spend a 2nd and 4th without blinking. This is an opportunity to ensure a great return on that 2nd rounder.  This kid is already showing enough return, right now.  However, his ceiling is high, and we get to fastforward 3 years on his development.   Honestly, I think a 2nd and 3rd would be fine here. \n\nWith this kid, this team will have loaded the short term cupboard in such a quick turnaround. Also, giving a young guy like this the chance to play with Sid could be huge for his development.  Worst case it could skyrocket his value if the rebuild is taking longer and you want to move on.  The real question is whether he'd want to come here.  \n\nWhat do yinz think?",

        "title": "Most important Contract, aside from 87??",
        "content": "Obviously, we're all waiting on the announcement in 16 days of Side's extension.  \n\nHowever, we have two other very compelling players up for extensions as well. Of Course, I'm referring to DOC and Marcus Pettersson.  Their situations could not be more different, but I'm of the opinion that both needs are very pressing, and should not wait until the season. \n\nLet's start with Pettersson - he's a \"home-grown\" defensive stalwart.  A 2014, 2nd rounder from the Ducks, acquired by the Pens in 2019 for Daniel Sprong, and was put right to work, eventually growing into the 5 year 20 million contract that he's finishing up this year.  \n\nPettersson is a lanky, rangy, if not terribly physical defensemen, who makes up for that lack of brute force with positioning, leverage, and technique.  Frankly, his net front battle against true power forwards in the league might be one of his few remaining areas to improve (along with finishing, but what do you expect from your defensivemost D).  He's 28, at the prime of his career, and is a sought after commodity. \n\n The market is not particularly strong for stay at home D - even the top guys.  Brenden Dillon, who you would have to consider a comp, just got 3 years at 12 million.  While a different player, Marino's contract is interesting for comp - 4.4 x6. Pelech is 5.75x8; Martinez ; Zub 4.6x4; Zadorov 5x6.Pettersson is most certainly not in the realm of Gustav Forsling, who just signed 8x5.75.  \n\nWhat would I do with Pettersson - offer him whatever term it took to get him signed for under 5 million per season, so long as he has not trade control.  From his perspective, why would he want to sign here longer than 3 years?  I don't see it.  So, sign him for however long he wants, but just be sure he has no more than 10 team after 3 years.  He will be a valuable trade asset at any point, and if we have him for some term at a reasonable price, he's even more valuable.  I'd hate to see the Pens mismanage this asset, going into the season, without having extended him, and then trade him for so much less return.  Even during a rebuild, he could be a real leader on the blue line.  \n\nDOC - he's in a very different position.  He just had his first real NHL experience, and acquitted himself where playing with more different players than probably anyone on the squad.  He centered lines, he was wing with 4 different centers, and he finished the season playing 17 games or so on the first line.  Now, I've seen some people looking at ADV stats and saying, man, this line was a huge + before him, then ended up -3 with him. However, keep in mind that his first games on teh 1st line were right after the Jake trade, when the whole team stopped skating in protest.  That, for the record is what cost us the playoffs, not the rest of the conjecture. \n\nAnyway, DOC put up 16G17A, and is a 6'3'' 26 year old.  Sure, he's a bit of a late bloomer. That cannot be challenged. He was a point per game player in the Ivy league, and got himself signed for that. His first season in WBS 20 games 19 points, 2nd 33 games 32 points, then 22 in 20.  He's exactly a PPG in at the AHL level over 3 season, before getting his full time run. He also did well in his early runs with the big club, putting up points, and playing bottom 6, PK, etc.  Making the most of opportunity.  Keep in mind his first seasons were between the clubs in the pandemic seasons - a true mess of a situation for player dev. \n\nWhat would I do:  4years at 3 million would be my target for him.   I would want him through the end of the run with the boys, and maybe a bit beyond - he could be a primary part of the next Pens, or he could be traded in 3 years for a great return if he keeps on this trajectory and we have him locked in a good deal.  Frankly, if they went 5x3.5 I wouldn't hate it, but that's probably the end.  Let's keep the fingers crossed that his want to play with Sid, gets him to resign cheap, and really make a name for himself. \n\n  \nLook forward to your thoughts, boys.  July is almost over at least.",

I figured a few people may want to do the same, or have this playlist saved if they want to look up a specific instance or whatever down the road. It may come in handy.\n\nLink: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeq_FxOhX48X1TYRIfqzP8zeKTueHO8KC\n\nEnjoy! It wasn't all bad haha",

The Flyers have made it clear that they’re not particularly trying to win. The Islanders are vanilla and haven’t improved much this offseason. I think Columbus will have a better season but won’t make the playoffs. Washington made some moves that could pay off if PLD actually tries plus they added a puck mover with a good shot in Chychrun. The Rangers are a solid team. Same with New Jersey. With that being said, I feel like the window is wide open for the Penguins to contend for top spot in the division. We’ve made some decent moves and added new some assistants. What do you guys foresee? I for one am ready for next season to start and am very optimistic.",

So if he can coach EK and the rest of the D-men to that level and the power play by extension, things might pick up. I’m choosing to be optimistic with these changes until things truly go to shit again like last season. \n\nHayes, Beauvillier etc might not be great top 6 guys but if they can play 3rd and 4th line minutes and be better than Harkins, Nieto and that shit show it’s a good thing. We still have OC, Bunting and Rust in the top 6 with Sid and Geno so at least those are set. \nEspecially the Malkin-Bunting pair, they went on a heater those last few weeks so them playing an entire season together will be good to see. He clicked with Geno right out the gate in a way none of the other revolving door of wingers had been able to. I’m going to hope this works until I see that its not before writing the season off as a failure.",
