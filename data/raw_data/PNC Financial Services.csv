History,"PNC Financial Services traces its history to the Pittsburgh Trust and Savings Company which was founded in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on April 10, 1845. Due to the long recovery from the Great Fire of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Trust and Savings was not fully operational until January 28, 1852. It originally opened offices at Liberty Avenue and 12th Street. The bank was renamed The Pittsburgh Trust Company in 1853. In 1858, the company located its corporate offices to the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street in Pittsburgh, where they remain to this day. The bank changed its name to First National Bank of Pittsburgh in 1863 after it became the first bank in the country to apply for a national charter as part of that year's National Banking Act. It received the 48th charter on August 5, 1863, with other later banks receiving charters sooner due to paperwork problems and the fact that the bank was already in business.
In 1946, First National merged with Peoples-Pittsburgh Trust Company – with whom it had worked closely since the 1930s – to form Peoples First National Bank & Trust. In 1959, Peoples First merged with Fidelity Trust Company to form Pittsburgh National Bank. At this time, the bank adopted the first version of its present logo – a stylized triangle representing the city's Golden Triangle. In 1969, the bank reorganized as a holding company, Pittsburgh National Corporation. 
Another branch of the current bank, the Philadelphia–based Provident National Corporation, dates back to 1865.
In 1982, Pittsburgh National Corporation and Provident National Corporation, both with PNC as their abbreviations, merged into a new entity named PNC Financial Corporation. It was the largest bank merger in American history at the time and created a company with $10.3 billion in assets. Between 1991 and 1996, PNC purchased more than ten smaller banks and financial institutions, including the $30 billion dollar merger of Midlantic Bank of Edison New Jersey in 1996, that at the time, was one-third the size of PNC. That broadened its market base from Kentucky to the New York metropolitan area.

Since 1984, PNC has compiled the Christmas Price Index, a humorous economic indicator which estimates the prices of the items found in the song ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"".
In 1998, PNC acquired Hilliard Lyons for $275 million in cash and stock. Hilliard Lyons was sold in 2008.

On October 24, 2008, during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the National City acquisition by PNC for $5.2 billion in stock was completed. The acquisition was financed with preferred stock sold to the United States Treasury as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program implemented as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The stock issued to the U.S. Treasury was repurchased in 2010. PNC then became the 5th largest bank in the United States by deposit and fourth largest by branches.
On August 14, 2009, PNC took over Dwelling House Savings & Loan and its only branch location in Pittsburgh's Hill District after Dwelling House failed and was placed in receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Dwelling House had been known in Pittsburgh to provide loans to low–income African Americans that other banks would deny. The branch was closed and accounts were transferred to the existing PNC branch in the Hill District.
In July 2010, PNC sold its Global Investment Servicing (GIS) subsidiary to The Bank of New York Mellon to repay funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which had been used for the National City acquisition (see above) in 2008. GIS, established in 1973 and with 4,700 employees, was the second–largest full–service mutual fund transfer agent in the U.S and the second–largest full–service accounting and administration provider to U.S. mutual funds. GIS serviced $1.9 trillion in total assets and 58 million shareholder accounts. It was known as PFPC until July 2008.

Two of PNC's ""Big Four"" competitors, Bank of America and Chase Bank, have both also been expanding into new markets through this method, including into PNC's home market of Pittsburgh.

Legal issues -> Overcharging of Black and Hispanic borrowers by National City,"In December 2013, the Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that they had reached an agreement with National City Bank to resolve allegations that the bank had charged Black and Hispanic borrowers higher prices for mortgages between 2002 and 2008, before the acquisition by PNC. Regulators claimed that National City had violated the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act by charging more than 75,000 borrowers higher loan rates based on their race or ethnicity rather than their risk level. National City's lack of pricing guidelines resulted in black borrowers being charged an average of $159 more in extra upfront fees or higher interest than white borrowers. Black borrowers also paid an average of $228 more annually over the life of the loan than white borrowers. Hispanics paid $125 more upfront and $154 more annually than white borrowers. Under the terms of the settlement, PNC was required to pay victims $35 million."

Legal issues -> Securities fraud settlement,"In June 2003, PNC Bank agreed to pay $115 million to settle federal securities fraud charges after one of its subsidiaries fraudulently transferred $762 million in bad loans and other venture capital investments to an AIG entity in order to conceal them from investors."
Legal issues -> Overtime claim by loan officers,"In 2017, PNC agreed to pay $16 million to settle claims of overtime wages by loan officers under the Fair Labor Standards Act."
