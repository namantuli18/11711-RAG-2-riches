"Professional baseball in the Pittsburgh area began in 1876 with the organization of the Allegheny Base Ball Club, an independent (non-league) club based in a then-separate city called Allegheny City, across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team joined the minor league International Association in 1877, only to fold the following season. On October 15, 1881, Denny McKnight held a meeting at Pittsburgh's St. Clair Hotel to organize a new Allegheny club, which began play in 1882 as a founding member of the American Association. Chartered as the Allegheny Base Ball Club of Pittsburgh, the team was listed as ""Allegheny"" in the standings, and was sometimes called the ""Alleghenys"" (rarely the ""Alleghenies"") in that era's custom of referring to a team by its pluralized city or club name. After five mediocre seasons, Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887.

Before the 1890 season, almost all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players' League's Pittsburgh Burghers. The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer, who had previously played with the A.A.'s Philadelphia Athletics. Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was ""piratical"". This incident quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, their allegedly ""piratical"" act gained them the occasional nickname ""Pirates"" starting in 1891. Within a few years, the nickname caught on with Pittsburgh newspapers. The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912. 
After almost two decades of mediocre baseball, the Pirates' fortunes began to change at the turn of the 20th century. The Pirates acquired several star players from the Louisville Colonels, who were slated for elimination when the N.L. contracted from 12 to 8 teams. (The franchises did not formally consolidate; the player acquisitions were separate transactions.) Among those players was Honus Wagner, who would become one of the first players inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The Pirates were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s, winning three consecutive National League pennants from 1901 to 1903 and participating in the first modern World Series ever played, which they lost to Boston. The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1909, defeating the Detroit Tigers for their first-ever world title. That year, the Pirates moved from Exposition Park to one of the first steel and concrete ballparks, Forbes Field.
As Wagner aged, the Pirates began to slip down the National League standings in the 1910s, culminating in a disastrous 51–103 record in 1917; however, veteran outfielder Max Carey and young players Pie Traynor and Kiki Cuyler, along with a remarkably deep pitching staff, brought the Pirates back to relevance in the 1920s. The Pirates won their second title in 1925, becoming the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit in the World Series. The Pirates returned to the World Series in 1927 but were swept by the Murderer's Row Yankees. The Pirates remained a competitive team through the 1930s but failed to win the pennant, coming closest in 1938 when they were passed by the Chicago Cubs in the final week of the season.
Despite the prowess of Ralph Kiner as a slugger, the Pirates were mostly miserable in the 1940s and 1950s. Branch Rickey was brought in to rebuild the team, which returned to the World Series in 1960. They were outscored over the course of the series by the Yankees, yet the Pirates won on a walk-off home run by Bill Mazeroski in the bottom of the 9th inning in Game 7. As of 2022, it is the only Game 7 walk-off home run in World Series history.
Led by right fielder Roberto Clemente, the Pirates remained a strong team throughout the 1960s but did not return to the World Series until 1971. Playing in the new Three Rivers Stadium, the Pirates defeated the favored Baltimore Orioles behind Clemente's hitting and the pitching of Steve Blass. In the same year on September 1, the Pirates became the first team to field an all-Black and Latino lineup.
Despite Clemente's death after the 1972 season, the Pirates were one of the dominant teams of the decade, winning the newly created National League East in 1970, 1971, 1972, 1974, 1975, and 1979. Powered by sluggers such as Willie Stargell, Dave Parker, and Al Oliver, the team was nicknamed ""The Lumber Company."" Behind Stargell's leadership and the disco song ""We Are Family"" (which the team adopted as its theme song), the Pirates came back from a 3–1 deficit to once again defeat the Orioles in the 1979 World Series for the franchise's fifth championship. During the 1979 championship season, a Pittsburgh player was designated as Most Valuable Player in every available category: All-Star Game MVP (Dave Parker), NLCS MVP (Willie Stargell), World Series MVP (Willie Stargell), and National League MVP (Willie Stargell, shared with Keith Hernandez of St. Louis).

The Pirates sank back into mediocrity in the 1980s and returned to post-season play in the early 1990s behind young players like Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla, and Doug Drabek. The Pirates won three straight division titles from 1990 to 1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series each time, notably coming within one out of advancing to the World Series in 1992. Several of the team's best players, including Bonds and Drabek, left as free agents after that season.

With salaries rising across baseball, the small-market Pirates struggled to keep pace with the sport and they posted a losing record for 20 consecutive seasons, a record among North American professional sports teams. Even the opening of a new stadium in 2001, PNC Park, did little to change the team's fortunes. The Pirates finally returned to the postseason in 2013 behind National League MVP Andrew McCutchen, defeating the Cincinnati Reds in the Wild Card Game. They were eliminated in five games in the next round by the St. Louis Cardinals. That season, the Pirates also became the seventh MLB team to reach 10,000 all-time  wins. On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss was the team's 10,000th making the Pirates the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, following the Philadelphia Phillies, Atlanta Braves, and the Chicago Cubs. The Pirates returned to the postseason in 2014 and 2015 and lost the Wild Card game both times and have not qualified for the playoffs since then.","The Pittsburgh Pirates began as an independent team in 1876 and eventually joined the American Association before switching to the National League in 1887. They experienced ups and downs over the years, including a brief period in the Players' League, a successful run in the early 1900s, and a resurgence in the 1920s and 1930s. The team has had a mixed history, with periods of dominance and mediocrity, and has been known by various nicknames throughout its history."
"The Pirates' first home was Exposition Park, located a couple blocks west of the current location of PNC Park. The Pirates split their early years between that ballpark and Recreation Park, which was located further inland from the flood-prone Allegheny River. The Pirates moved back to Exposition Park for good in 1891, and remained there until the 1909 season. The park hosted the first modern World Series ever played in 1903 but by the end of the decade the wooden structure was too small for the Pirates' growing fanbase. Exposition Park hosted several minor league teams before being razed prior to 1920. The site is currently occupied by a parking lot and several restaurants, although a historical marker near the intersection of West Gen. Robinson Street and Tony Dorsett Drive notes it was the location of the first World Series.

In the middle of the 1909 season, the Pirates moved into Forbes Field in Oakland, which would serve as the club's home for the next 61 years. Built at a cost of $1 million, the park was the first three-tiered steel-and-concrete ballpark in the nation. Forbes Field was expanded several times over the decades, with capacity almost doubled from its initial 23,000 in 1909 to 41,000 in 1925 (although it was reduced to 35,000 in its later years). Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss ""hated cheap home runs and vowed he'd have none in his park"", which led him to design a large playing field for Forbes Field. When a large grandstand was constructed down the right field line in the early 1920s, reducing the distance to 300 feet from home plate, Dreyfuss had a 28-foot screen erected. Despite this, Forbes Field is remembered for several famous home runs: the final three homers of Babe Ruth's career on May 25, 1935 and Bill Mazeroski's championship-winning blast in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series. The park also hosted football games for the Pittsburgh Steelers and University of Pittsburgh ""Pitt"" Panthers. Located in a sparsely populated area of the city when it opened in 1909, by the 1960s Forbes Field was surrounded by the University of Pittsburgh campus. The Pirates left the ballpark midway through the 1970 season and the stadium was demolished the following year. Sections of the outfield wall remain standing along Roberto Clemente Drive, and the home plate used in the stadium's final game remains preserved in the University of Pittsburgh's Posvar Hall.
The Pirates moved into the multipurpose Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, which they shared with the Steelers. Like other multi-purpose stadiums popular at the time, Three Rivers featured extensive box seats, a turf playing field, and moveable seating sections to accommodate both football and baseball. Three Rivers ended up being much better suited for the former than the latter, and the Pirates struggled to draw fans despite their on-field success in the 1970s. By the 1990s, the Pirates were threatening to leave Pittsburgh unless a new, baseball-only stadium was constructed. The Pirates played their final game at Three Rivers on October 1, 2000, and the stadium was demolished the following winter. The site is currently occupied by parking lots and Stage AE, although one of the stadium's entrance markers remains standing near Acrisure Stadium. In 2012, members of the Society for American Baseball Research marked and painted the home plate and first base of the former stadium on the 40th Anniversary of Roberto Clemente's 3,000th hit.","The Pirates played their first home games at Exposition Park, which was later razed and replaced by Forbes Field."
"Since 1969, the Pirates have held Spring Training at LECOM Park in Bradenton, Florida, which is also used for the Pirates' minor league team, the Bradenton Marauders. Constructed in 1923, LECOM Park is the oldest stadium still in use for Spring Training and the second-oldest minor league park, behind only Jackie Robinson Ballpark in Daytona Beach, which dates to 1914. It is also the third oldest stadium currently used by a major league team after Fenway Park, built in 1912, and Wrigley Field, built in 1914. Built in a Florida Spanish Mission style, LECOM Park underwent two major renovations in 1993 and 2008, the latter of which added lights. The park was formerly named ""McKechnie Field,"" for Bradenton resident and Baseball Hall of Fame great Bill McKechnie, who led the Pirates in 1925; since 2017 it has been named for the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, which has its main campus in Erie, Pennsylvania, and also a campus in Bradenton. Pirate City, the site of the Pirates' Spring Training complex, is located a few miles east of LECOM Park.","The Pirates have played at LECOM Park in Bradenton, Florida since 1969, a stadium that is the oldest still in use for Spring Training and the second-oldest minor league park."
"The Pirates have had many uniforms and logo changes over the years, with the only consistency being the ""P"" on the team's cap. Like other teams in Major League Baseball, the Pirates predominantly favored a patriotic red, white and blue color scheme through the first half of the 20th Century. During this time, the Pirates predominantly wore a blue cap, with either a red or white P. The uniforms were plain, often including a simple ""P"" if anything at all. The team's name was first acknowledged in 1912, with a pinstripe jersey that had ""Pirates"" running vertically down the placket. The team's name would not appear on the club's uniforms again until they were added to the road uniforms in 1933, this time written horizontally in a more ornate style. An image of a pirate's head appeared on the home and road jerseys for the 1940 and 1941 seasons (this image would be reused for the team's logo in the 1980s and 1990s), and ""Pittsburgh"" first appeared on the road uniforms in 1942.
In 1948, the team broke away from the patriotic ""Red, White, & Blue"" color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of the Flag of Pittsburgh and, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively unknown Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League. The Pirates had made a similar change to black and gold in 1924, but the change did not last beyond that season. Along with the San Francisco Giants, the Pirates are one of two pre-expansion National League teams that completely changed their colors, although red returned as an ""accent color"" in 1997 and remained until 2009.
In the late 1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by the team (the honor goes to the Cincinnati Reds), the Pirates helped popularize the look. Coinciding with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team switched to a darker shade of gold and changed their caps from black to gold with a black brim; they also introduced pullover nylon/cotton jerseys and beltless pants as part of their new uniform set (later to become polyester doubleknit). The Pirates became the first team in baseball to sport such a look, but it quickly became popular throughout the league, and the pullover style would become the prominent look of 1970s and 1980s baseball. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch.

In 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes. After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons. The Pirates switched back to a brighter shade of gold for the 1977 season, and became one of the first teams to wear third jerseys, following the Oakland Athletics. Starting in 1977, the Pirates had uniform styles which included two different caps and three different uniforms: an all-black set, an all-gold set, and a white set with black-and-gold pinstripes. The pants, tops and caps could all be worn interchangeably for different looks; the Pirates wore four different uniform combinations in the 1979 World Series. The pinstripes came off the white uniforms in 1980, but the Pirates continued to utilize the three uniform set until the 1985 season, when the team returned to the straightforward home whites/road grays combination. The solid black cap with a gold ""P"" returned in 1987 and has been the team's primary cap ever since.
After Kevin McClatchy purchased the team in 1996, the Pirates added a third jersey and utilized red as an accent color, including red brims on the team's caps. A sleeveless white jersey with pinstripes was worn as an alternate home jersey from 2005 to 2010, and a red alternate jersey was added for the 2007 and 2008 seasons. In 2009, the Pirates began wearing an alternate black jersey with a gold ""P"" at both home and on the road. From 2013 to 2019, the Pirates wore throwback uniforms for Sunday home games: the early 70s pullover uniforms from 2013 to 2015, and the gold top/black pants from the late 70s from 2016 to 2019.
Since the 2015 season, the Pirates have worn an alternate camo jersey for select home games. The camouflage alternates were updated for the 2018 season, now white with camo green wordmarks, numbers, piping, and patches.
Ahead of the 2020 season, the Pirates revived the script ""Pittsburgh"" wordmarks on their gray road and new black alternate road jerseys, which were unveiled on January 24, 2020. Script wordmarks had previously been seen on the road jerseys from 1990 until 2000. The alternate road jersey also features a Pirate wearing a re-colored bandana, yellow to match the theme of the jersey, and is worn with a black cap featuring the ""P"" logo outlined in black and yellow. In addition to these road uniforms, the Pirates continue to wear their white uniforms, the black alternate with the gold ""P"", and the camo alternate for games played at PNC Park.
In 2023, the Pirates retired the camo home alternate to comply with the new ""4+1"" rule, restricting teams to a home, away, two alternate uniforms and a City Connect uniform. The Pirates continued to wear the camo cap on occasion with the home white uniform. They also unveiled their City Connect uniform, featuring a gold top and black pants with a gold ""P"" cap with black brim. The jersey itself features the abbreviation of Pittsburgh ""PGH"". A closer look of the jersey feature the Three Elements. The inverted ""Y"", representing the three rivers that meet in Pittsburgh (Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio). The astroid, or the diamond shape star represents the famous ""Steelmark"" logo and the Check or the Checkbox, represents the Seal of Pittsburgh.","The Pirates have had numerous uniform changes over the years, with the ""P"" logo on the cap being the only consistent element."
"The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League until 1994. It began when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered the NL in 1887, four years after the Phillies.
The Phillies and the Pirates remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969–1993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s. The Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.
After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished. However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team, with regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fueling the rivalry.","The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates was once one of the best in the National League, but has diminished since the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994."
"The Pirates' biggest divisional rival is the Cincinnati Reds, given the two teams' proximity, the carryover of the cities' football rivalry, and the fact that the Reds and Pirates have met six times in the postseason, most recently in the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. In the 2010s, the two teams frequently hit each other with pitches, occasionally resulting in brawls.","The Cincinnati Reds are the Pirates' biggest divisional rival due to their proximity, football rivalry, and postseason meetings."
"From 2013 to 2015, the Pirates battled with the St. Louis Cardinals for the Central Division title, with the Cardinals narrowly winning the division each year. The two teams faced off in the 2013 National League Division Series, which the Cardinals won in five games. The Pirates had a contentious battle with the Milwaukee Brewers for a Wild Card spot in 2014 and faced off against the Chicago Cubs in the 2015 National League Wild Card Game. The Cubs were major rivals for the Pirates earlier in their history, as both were among the best teams in baseball in the early 1900s and the Cubs eliminated the Pirates from the pennant race in the last week of 
the 1938 season.",The document discusses the rivalry between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the St. Louis Cardinals over the Central Division title from 2013 to 2015.
"The Pirates play an annual interleague series against the Detroit Tigers. While the Pirates and Tigers only became ""natural rivals"" because the other AL and NL Central teams were already paired up, it has become popular with fans of both teams, possibly due to the rivalry between the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins. The two teams have several other connections as well. The Tigers' AA Minor League affiliate, the Erie SeaWolves, located near Pittsburgh, is a former affiliate of the Pirates and has retained the logo of a wolf wearing a pirate bandanna and eye patch. Additionally, Jim Leyland, former manager of both the Pirates (1986–1996) and the Tigers (2005–2013), remains popular in Pittsburgh where he resides. The Pirates led the regular-season series, 36–29. The two teams played in the 1909 World Series.
An on-and-off rivalry with the Cleveland Guardians stems from the close proximity of both cities, and features some carryover elements from the longstanding rivalry in the National Football League between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers. Because the Guardians' designated interleague rival is the Reds and the Pirates' designated rival is the Tigers, the teams have only played periodically.  The teams played one three-game series each year from 1997 to 2001 and periodically between 2002 and 2022, generally only in years in which the AL Central played the NL Central in the former interleague play rotation. The teams played six games in 2020 as MLB instituted an abbreviated schedule focusing on regional match-ups. Beginning in 2023, the teams will play a three-game series each season as a result of the new ""balanced"" schedule.  The Pirates lead the series 21–18.","The Pirates and Tigers have a long-standing rivalry dating back to their natural pairing in the AL and NL Central, with connections to the NHL's Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins."
"Along with the league-wide retired number of 42, there are nine retired Pirates jersey numbers to date. As of June 12, 2019, Bill Mazeroski is the lone survivor of the Pittsburgh Pirates whose numbers are retired.",Bill Mazeroski is the only remaining Pirate whose jersey numbers have been retired.
"In 2022, the Pirates formally established a team Hall of Fame to honor the ""most influential ballplayers in Pittsburgh baseball history"", as picked by an internal committee that had the help of team historian Jim Trdinich. 19 individuals were part of the first class, which included every Pittsburgh Pirate inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame along with several other former players, broadcasters, and coaches. Like the Washington Nationals with the Ring of Honor, the Pirates inducted players that had played for the Negro league baseball team Homestead Grays, which had played in Forbes Field and Greenlee Field in Pittsburgh alongside their time in Washington; two of the first class also spent time with the Pittsburgh Crawfords, with a ceremony dedicated to ""signing"" the four to Pirates contracts. All inductees were honored with a plaque displayed in the concourse by the entrance with the statue of Roberto Clemente.","The Pirates established a team Hall of Fame in 2022 to honor influential ballplayers from Pittsburgh baseball history, including those inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and others from the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords."

"On May 8, 1886, the Pittsburgh Alleghenys turned the first 3–4–2 triple play in Major League history. In the fourth inning of a game, the Cincinnati Red Stockings put runners in first and second with no outs. John Reilly grounded out to first base, where Fred Carroll recorded the first out. He threw to second base, where Sam Barkley made the tag for the second out. The runner from second decided to try for home plate and he was cut down on a throw from Barkley and a tag by Doggie Miller. The Alleghenys won the game, 9–6.
First ever Major League Baseball game broadcast on the radio, a game between the Pirates and the host Philadelphia Phillies aired August 5, 1921, on KDKA (AM) Pittsburgh. The Pirates won the game, 8–5.
In 1925, the Pirates became the first MLB team to recover from a 3-games-to-1 deficit in winning a best-of-seven World Series; they then became the first MLB team to repeat that feat in 1979.
During the 1953 season, the Pirates became the first team to permanently adopt batting helmets on both offense and defense. These helmets resembled a primitive fiberglass ""miner's cap"". This was the mandate of general manager Branch Rickey, who also owned stock in the company producing the helmets. Under Rickey's orders, all Pirate players had to wear the helmets both at bat and in the field. The helmets became a permanent feature for all Pirate hitters, but within a few weeks the team began to abandon their use of helmets in the field, partly because of their awkward and heavy feel. Once the Pirates discarded the helmets on defense, the trend disappeared from the game. In 2014, Major League Baseball allowed pitchers to choose to wear a padded hat that aims to combine the added safety of a helmet with the comfort of a baseball cap. The cap would prove widely unpopular, with only Alex Torres of the New York Mets choosing to wear it.
First franchise to win a World Series on a home run (1960 World Series) in the 7th game. The only other team to accomplish this feat is the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993, though theirs came in Game 6.
In 1970 the Pirates became the first major league club to create their uniforms using a cotton-nylon blend featuring pull-over shirts and beltless pants.
The first all-minority lineup in MLB history took the field on September 1, 1971. The lineup was Rennie Stennett, Gene Clines, Roberto Clemente, Willie Stargell, Manny Sanguillén, Dave Cash, Al Oliver, Jackie Hernández, and Dock Ellis.
The first World Series night game was played in Three Rivers Stadium on October 13, 1971—eleven years to the day since Mazeroski's walk-off homer brought the Pirates their last World Series title in 1960. In this case, however, it was Game 4 between the Pirates and the Baltimore Orioles, rather than a decisive Game 7. Apparently, good things happen for the Pirates on this date, as they knotted the 1971 World Series at two games apiece on their way to their fourth title.
The first MLB scout to win the ""Scout of the Year Award"", Howie Haak, in 1984, three additional scouts from the organization have subsequently won the award.
The first combined extra inning no-hitter in MLB history took place at Three Rivers Stadium on July 12, 1997. Francisco Córdova (9 innings) and Ricardo Rincón (1 inning) combined to no-hit the Houston Astros, 3–0 in 10 innings. Pinch-hitter Mark Smith's three-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th inning sealed the victory and the no-hitter for the Pirates. It remains the only such no-hitter to date.
In November 2008, the Pirates became the first MLB team to sign Indian players when they acquired the non-draft free agents of Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel. This was also seen by Pirates general manager Neal Huntington, as ""not only add[ing] two prospects to our system but also hope to open a pathway to an untapped market.""
The Pirates are the first team in professional sports to have 20 consecutive losing seasons. This streak lasted from 1993 to 2012. This is the longest such streak in North American professional sports history.
The Pirates are the first MLB team (as well as only second in major professional sports) to be owned by an openly gay owner, although Kevin McClatchy had already divested his shares in the Pirates when he openly announced his homosexuality in September 2012.
On April 6, 2015, the Pirates' loss to the Cincinnati Reds earned the team its 10,000 franchise loss and making the Pirates the first MLB team to reach their 10,000th loss on an Opening Day.
On May 9, 2015, the Pirates became the first MLB team to turn a 4–5–4 triple play. The triple play occurred during a 7–5 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. The play occurred when the Cardinals' Yadier Molina lined out to Pittsburgh second baseman Neil Walker. Walker then threw to third baseman Jung Ho Kang to double off the Cardinals' Jhonny Peralta for the second out. Kang then threw the ball back to Walker, who was standing on second base for the final out after St. Louis's Jason Heyward froze between second and third.
On April 24, 2017, the Pirates fielded the first baseball player to be born and raised in Lithuania, to reach the major leagues, Dovydas Neverauskas. In 1933, Joe Zapustas was the first Lithuanian-born player to play in MLB, as a member of the Philadelphia Athletics, however, he grew up in Boston.
On April 26, 2017, the Pirates promoted South African Gift Ngoepe from the AAA Indianapolis Indians; making him the first African-born player in MLB history.
On August 23, 2017, the Pirates became the first team in MLB history to break up a no-hitter in extra innings with a walk-off home run. The home run was hit by Josh Harrison in the tenth inning, off of pitcher Rich Hill, to give the Pirates a 1–0 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers.","The document provides a chronological summary of significant events and milestones in the history of the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, including their firsts in baseball history, notable achievements, and key moments in their history."

"Throughout the 1940s Pirates owner William Benswanger was a leading advocate of integration of the Major Leagues, once planning a tryout for African American players to sign up for the club.
The Pirates organization was the first in baseball to have both an African-American coach and manager, when Gene Baker broke the color line in 1961 and 1962 respectively. On September 21, 1963, the Pirates were the first MLB team to have an African-American manager in Gene Baker, as he filled in for Danny Murtaugh.
On September 1, 1971, manager Murtaugh assembled a starting lineup that was completely composed of minority players for the first time in MLB history.","The document discusses the integration efforts of the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball, including their early attempts to integrate the Major Leagues and their first African-American managers and coaches."
"Even though they have had some notable fans including former part-owner Bing Crosby, Michael Keaton, and Regis Philbin, the Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third in Pittsburgh behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins in popularity among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams. However, due to their long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season, the team has retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region, especially among older residents. Upon the team ending their 20-season losing season streak with a winning season in 2013, the fan support for the club has grown once again but still remaining a distant third behind the city's other 2 more successful franchises in the last half-century.
While the team's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the Super Bowl 3 times (XIV, XL, and XLIII) and the Penguins the Stanley Cup five times in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017, including both in 2009), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s, the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped. The team's standing among fans has, however, improved along with the team on the field and the opening of PNC Park in 2001. Following the Andrew McCutchen trade in 2018, fan relations have deteriorated despite the Pirates contending for the NL Central during 2018 due to backlash towards owner Robert Nutting, with the team ranking 27th among 30 MLB team in attendance that season.
When the Penguins won the Stanley Cup in 2009 captain Sidney Crosby brought the cup to PNC Park on the Sunday following the team's victory in Detroit. When they won again in 2017 the cup was once again brought to PNC Park and the team threw out the first pitch. The team won the cup in 1992 and they held a celebration in the Pirates' old home Three Rivers Stadium.","The Pirates are a professional baseball team in Pittsburgh, known for their long-standing history and strong fan base, despite their recent struggles compared to the city's other two major professional sports teams."
"Each year, the Pirates recognize six ""Community Champions"" during a special pregame ceremony.
Piratefest is a yearly event that is held by the Pittsburgh Pirates in January. The event is, in essence, a baseball carnival for the whole family. It features autograph sessions from current and former Pirates players and coaches, live events and games, carnival booths, baseball clinics, ""Ask Pirates Management"", and appearances by the Pirate Parrot. Piratefest was once held at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown Pittsburgh but is now held annually at the ballpark.",Piratefest is a yearly baseball-themed carnival event held by the Pittsburgh Pirates.
"The Pirates broadcast the first ever baseball game over the radio on August 5, 1921. Harold Arlin, a foreman at Westinghouse, announced the game over KDKA from a box seat next to the first base dugout at Forbes Field. KDKA had received its broadcasting license only nine months before, becoming the first commercially licensed radio station in the world. Pirate games would be sporadically broadcast over the radio for the next decade; regular broadcasts began in the mid-1930s, with Rosey Rowswell becoming the voice of the Pirates in 1936. Except for a few years on WWSW in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Pirates were on KDKA for 61 years. KDKA's 50,000-watt clear channel enabled Pirates fans across the eastern half of North America at night to hear the games.
In 2007, the Pirates chose to end the longest relationship between a team and a radio station in American professional sports and moved to FM talk radio station WPGB. The Pirates cited the desire to reach more people in the 25–54 age bracket coveted by advertisers. The acquisition of the rights means that Clear Channel Communications holds the rights to every major sports team in Pittsburgh. The Pirates have long had a radio network that has extended across four states. Stations for the 2007 season included Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Maryland radio broadcasters.
On October 1, 2011, Clear Channel announced that they would not renew their deal with the Pirates, and the team shortly thereafter announced a deal to transfer back to CBS Radio via FM sports radio station KDKA-FM, which became official on October 12.
On March 2, 2016, it was announced a new deal was reached for the Pirates to remain on KDKA-FM. As part of the deal, KDKA-AM has returned as essentially the AM flagship of the team, simulcasting all weekday afternoon games, select other broadcasts, and serving as the backup station for any games that KDKA-FM can not air due to conflicts with Pittsburgh Panthers football and men's basketball.
Games are televised on SportsNet Pittsburgh, the Pirates' cable television outlet since 1986, when it was known as KBL. The network is majority owned by Fenway Sports Group, owners of the Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh Penguins. The Pirates became joint owners of the channel on December 16, 2023, with operations to be produced by the Red Sox's home network NESN. During the 2016 season, the Pirates averaged a 7.22 rating and 83,000 viewers on primetime TV broadcasts. Apart from any Pirates games aired nationally on Fox, there has been no over-the-air coverage of the Pirates since 2002. Previously, KDKA-TV aired Pirates games for 38 years (1957–1994). Games also aired on WPXI (1995–1996) and on WPGH-TV and WCWB (1997–2002).",The Pirates broadcast the first ever baseball game over the radio in 1921 and have been on KDKA-FM for 61 years.
"Current
The Pirates have no set broadcast team for radio or TV; instead, all announcers and analysts take turns working in both mediums over the course of a season. The longest-tenured broadcasters are play-by-play announcer Greg Brown and analyst Bob Walk, both of whom joined the broadcast booth in 1994. Former Pirate and Pittsburgh native John Wehner joined the crew in 2005 as an analyst, while Joe Block became the team's second play-by-play announcer in 2016 after previously working for the Milwaukee Brewers. Former Pirate players who have recently filled in as analysts include Matt Capps, Kevin Young, and Neil Walker.
Past
Westinghouse Electric foreman Harold Arlin called the first-ever radio broadcast of a baseball game, an 8-5 Phillies victory over the Pirates on August 5, 1921. A rotating group of announcers would call games over the next 15 years until Rosey Rowswell joined the broadcast team in 1936. Rowswell did not travel with the team for road games, instead re-creating the action in Pittsburgh after it came in over the teleprinter, usually an inning or so behind. After working solo for a decade, he was joined in the booth by Bob Prince in 1947; Prince would become the lead play-by-play man after Rowswell died in February 1955. Prince's broadcasting style made him immensely popular with fans, and his almost 30-year run with the club coincided with the Pirates' rise to a championship-caliber team. Nicknamed ""The Gunner,"" Prince was known for his ""Gunnerisms""—nicknames and quips—and created the Green Weenie in 1966. He also called the Pirates' championships in 1960 and 1971 as part of the national broadcast for NBC.
Prince and his broadcast partner Nellie King were fired in 1975, which drew the ire of the Pirates' fanbase. Milo Hamilton and Lanny Frattare took over as the new broadcast team in 1976. Hamilton was unhappy in Pittsburgh; he didn't get along with Frattare and felt that he was being criticized for not being Bob Prince. Hamilton left to join the Chicago Cubs after the 1979 season, and Frattare was elevated to the lead play-by-play announcer. Frattare would continue to call Pirate games through the 2008 season, becoming the longest tenured play-by-play man in team history. In turn, he was replaced by Tim Neverett, who called Pirate games from 2009 through 2015.
Former analysts include Don Hoak, Nelson Briles, and Jim Rooker. Former Pirate pitcher Steve Blass, who won Game 7 of the 1971 World Series, worked as a color analyst for the team from 1983 to 2019.","The Pirates have a rotating broadcast team for radio and TV, with former players filling in as analysts."
"In the 1969 draft the Penguins selected Michel Briere who, although being chosen 26th, was soon drawing comparisons to Phil Esposito and Bobby Clarke. Joining the team in November, he finished as the second-place rookie scorer in the NHL (behind Bobby Clarke) with 44 points (57th overall), and third on the Penguins. Briere placed second in Calder Memorial Trophy voting for Rookie of the Year honors behind Chicago goaltender Tony Esposito. Briere led Pittsburgh to its first NHL playoff berth since the 1928 Pirates. The Penguins defeated the Oakland Seals in a four-game sweep in the quarterfinals, with Briere scoring the series-clinching goal in overtime. In the semi-final round, defending conference champions St. Louis Blues got the best of the Penguins during six games. Briere led the team in playoff scoring, recording five goals (including three game-winners) and eight points. Tragedy struck the Penguins just days after their playoff heroics. On May 15, 1970, Briere was in a car crash in his native Quebec, suffering brain trauma and slipping into a coma from which he would never recover; he died a year later. His number 21 jersey was never reissued, remaining out of circulation until it was formally retired in 2001.
In the 1970–71 season, the Penguins finished five games out of the playoffs with a 21–37–20 record, the fourth-worst record in the league. Pittsburgh achieved a playoff berth in 1972, only to be swept by the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round. Except for a handful of players like Ken Schinkel, Pronovost, Syl Apps Jr., Keith McCreary, agitator Bryan Watson and goaltender Les Binkley, talent was thin, but enough for the Penguins to reach the playoffs in both 1970 and 1972.
The Penguins battled the California Golden Seals for the division cellar in 1974, when Riley was fired as general manager and replaced by Jack Button. Button obtained Steve Durbano, Ab DeMarco, Bob ""Battleship"" Kelly and Bob Paradise through trades. The personnel moves proved successful, and the team improved to a 28–41–9 record, although they remained nine points away from a playoff berth.
However, in early 1975, the Penguins' creditors demanded payment of back debts, forcing the team into bankruptcy. The doors to the team's offices were padlocked, and it looked like the Penguins would fold or relocate. Around the same time, rumors began circulating that the Penguins and the California Golden Seals were to be relocated to Seattle and Denver respectively, the two cities that were to have been the sites of an expansion for the 1976–77 season. Through the intervention of a group that included former Minnesota North Stars head coach Wren Blair, the team was prevented from folding and remained in Pittsburgh, eventually being bought by shopping mall magnate Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr.","Michel Briere, a 1969 draft pick of the Penguins, led the team to its first NHL playoff berth in 1970, but tragically died in a car accident shortly after. The Penguins struggled in the 1970-71 season, finishing fifth in the league, and faced financial difficulties in 1975, leading to a relocation threat."
"Beginning in the mid-1970s, Pittsburgh iced some powerful offensive clubs, led by the likes of the ""Century Line"" of Syl Apps, Lowell MacDonald and Jean Pronovost. They nearly reached the Stanley Cup semi-finals in 1975, but were ousted from the playoffs by the New York Islanders in one of the only four best-of-seven-game series in NHL history where a team came back from being down three games to none. As the 1970s wore on, a mediocre team defense neutralized the Penguins' success beyond the regular season. Baz Bastien, a former coach and general manager of the AHL's Hornets, later became general manager. The Penguins missed the playoffs in 1977–78. Bastien traded prime draft picks for several players whose best years were already behind them, and the team would suffer in the early 1980s as a result. The decade closed with a playoff appearance in 1979 and a rousing opening series win over the Buffalo Sabres before a second-round sweep at the hands of the Boston Bruins.
The Penguins began the 1980s by changing their team colors; in January 1980, the team switched from wearing blue and white to their present-day scheme of black and gold to honor Pittsburgh's other sports teams, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers, as well as the Flag of Pittsburgh. Both the Pirates and Steelers had worn black and gold for decades, and both had enjoyed world championship seasons. The Bruins protested this color change, claiming a monopoly on black and gold, but the Penguins defended their choice stating that the NHL Pirates also used black and gold as their team colors and that black and gold were Pittsburgh's traditional sporting colors. The NHL agreed, and Pittsburgh could use black and gold. The Penguins officially debuted the black and gold uniform in a game against the St. Louis Blues at the Civic Arena on January 30, 1980. On the ice, the Penguins began the 1980s with defenseman Randy Carlyle, and prolific scorers Paul Gardner and Mike Bullard but little else.
During the early part of the decade, the Penguins made a habit of being a tough draw for higher-seeded opponents in the playoffs. In 1980, the 13th-seeded Penguins took the Bruins to the limit in their first-round playoff series. The following season, as the 15th seed, they lost the decisive game of their first-round series in overtime to the heavily favored St. Louis Blues. Then, in the 1982 playoffs, the Penguins held a 3–1 lead late in the fifth and final game of their playoff series against the reigning champions, the New York Islanders. However, the Islanders rallied to force overtime and won the series on a goal by John Tonelli, who had tied the game before. It would be the Pens' final playoff appearance until 1989.","The Pittsburgh Penguins struggled in the 1970s and early 1980s due to poor defense and missed opportunities, but made a comeback in the 1980s with a new color scheme and a strong lineup."
"A herniated disc in Lemieux's back cut short his 1989–90 season, although he still amassed 123 points. However, the Penguins fell out of the playoff picture. They opted to strengthen their roster and support Lemieux in the 1990 off-season. Free-agent signings (Bryan Trottier) and trades (Joe Mullen, Larry Murphy, Ron Francis and Ulf Samuelsson) played a major part in this. Arguably no move was bigger during this time than when the Penguins drafted Jaromir Jagr with the fifth overall pick in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. The first Czechoslovak player to be drafted into the NHL without first needing to defect to the West, Jagr became the Penguins' second franchise player, and quickly developed into a superstar offensive talent.
The roster overhaul culminated in the Penguins winning their first Stanley Cup title by defeating the Minnesota North Stars in the Stanley Cup Finals in six games, punctuated by an 8–0 victory in the deciding game, the largest margin of victory in a final Stanley Cup game in over 80 years. After the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals, the Penguins met with President George H. W. Bush, the first NHL team ever to visit the White House. The following season, the team lost coach Bob Johnson to cancer, and Scotty Bowman took over as coach. Under Bowman, they swept the Chicago Blackhawks to repeat as Stanley Cup champions in 1991–92.
Cancer revisited the Penguins in 1993 when Lemieux was tragically diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma. Only two months after the diagnosis, missing 24 out of 84 games, he came back to win his fourth Art Ross Trophy as scoring champion with 160 points, edging out Pat LaFontaine and Adam Oates. Despite the off-ice difficulties, Pittsburgh finished with a 56–21–7 record, the franchise's best regular season ever, winning the Presidents' Trophy. After Lemieux's return, the team played better than it ever had before, winning an NHL-record 17 consecutive games. Despite all of this success, the New York Islanders eliminated them in the second round of Game 7 in overtime.
The Penguins continued to be a formidable team throughout the 1990s. The stars of the Stanley Cup years were followed by the likes of forwards: Alexei Kovalev, Martin Straka, Aleksey Morozov, Robert Lang and Petr Nedved, and defensemen Sergei Zubov, Darius Kasparaitis and Kevin Hatcher. Despite the departure of many of the franchise's Stanley Cup-winning roster, the Penguins fielded enough talent to reach the first round of the playoffs in 1994 (where they lost to the Washington Capitals in six games), the second round in 1995 (where they lost to the New Jersey Devils in five games) and the conference finals in 1996 (where they lost to the Florida Panthers in seven games). The 1997 playoffs marked a turning point, as the Penguins suffered a first-round elimination at the hands of the rival Philadelphia Flyers in five games.","The Pittsburgh Penguins won their first Stanley Cup in 1991, led by Jaromir Jagr and Mike Lemieux, and went on to dominate the league in the 1990s."
"On April 6, 1997, the franchise was rocked when Mario Lemieux, citing ongoing health concerns and his disapproval with the way NHL hockey was being officiated, announced he would retire at the conclusion of the 1997 playoffs. Lemieux was so respected in the NHL, and his achievements over the course of his career were so great, that he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the year he retired, the three-year waiting period being waived. His departure was the first in a series of events that would once again lead the Penguins into regular season stagnation, and to the brink of financial ruin.
The Montreal Canadiens eliminated the team in the first round of the playoffs in 1998, despite being the second-seeded team in the East. The following year, their playoff run ended in the second round when they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games. In 2000, the Penguins stunned the highly touted Washington Capitals 4–1 in the first round, only to fall to the Philadelphia Flyers 4–2 in the second round.
By this time, the lofty contracts handed out during the early 1990s were catching up with the Penguins. At one point, the team owed over $90 million to numerous creditors, leading then-owners Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg (who bought the Penguins after their first Stanley Cup win) to ask the players to defer their salaries to help pay the bills. When the deferred salaries finally came due, combined with other financial pressures, the Penguins were forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1998.
Lemieux then stepped in with an unusual proposal to buy the team out of bankruptcy. The Penguins owed Lemieux $32.5 million in deferred salary, making him the team's largest individual creditor. He proposed recovering this money by converting it into equity—enough to give him controlling interest. He also vowed to keep the team in Pittsburgh. The NHL and the courts agreed, and Lemieux (with help from supermarket tycoon Ronald Burkle) assumed control on September 3, 1999, saving the franchise for the second time.
Lemieux again shocked the hockey world by announcing at a press conference on December 8, 2000, his intentions to return to the Penguins as an active player. On December 27, 2000, Lemieux stepped onto NHL ice for the first time in 44 months, officially becoming the first player–owner in NHL history. Lemieux helped lead the Penguins deep into the 2001 playoffs, highlighted by an overtime victory against the Buffalo Sabres in Game 7 of the second round. Darius Kasparaitis scored the series-clinching goal to advance the Penguins to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost in five games to the New Jersey Devils.","Mario Lemieux's retirement in 1997 led to the Penguins' financial struggles, which culminated in bankruptcy in 1998. Lemieux's return as an active player in 2000 helped the team regain some stability and made it to the Eastern Conference Finals in 2001."
"The Penguins' attendance had dwindled in the late 1990s. In 1998–99, the club had an average attendance of 14,825 at home games, the lowest it had been since Lemieux's rookie year. Reducing revenue on top of the previous bankruptcy necessitated salary shedding. The biggest salary move was the trading of superstar Jaromir Jagr to the Washington Capitals in the summer of 2001. The Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years in 2002, finishing in a tie for third-to-last in their conference. The following season they finished second-last. In the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, the Penguins selected goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury with the first overall pick.
The 2003–04 season was an ordeal with Lemieux missing all but 24 regular season games with a hip injury, and attendance dipping to an average of 11,877 (the lowest average of any NHL team), with just one sellout. As the season progressed, the Penguins signed new head coach (and former Penguins' player and commentator) Eddie Olczyk and opted not to include Fleury in the lineup for the bulk of the season. This culminated in the worst record in the NHL, with the team winning just 23 games. As in the 1980s, the Penguins' struggles were fortuitously concurrent with a string of NHL Entry Draft classes that would yield multiple world-class talents. The Penguins lost out on the first overall pick for the 2004 NHL Entry Draft (Alexander Ovechkin), which went to the Washington Capitals. However, Ovechkin's countryman, center Evgeni Malkin, was similarly highly regarded, and Pittsburgh took him with the second overall pick. However, a transfer dispute between the NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) delayed his Pittsburgh debut.
By this point, the Penguins had collapsed financially since the Stanley Cup-winning years of the early 1990s. Their home venue, the Civic Arena, had become the oldest arena in the NHL, and Lemieux had tried unsuccessfully to cut a deal with the city for a new facility. With Pittsburgh uninterested in building a new hockey arena for the struggling Penguins, Lemieux began looking into the possibilities of selling or relocating the team to Kansas City, Missouri. A lockout prompted the cancellation of the 2004–05 NHL season. One of the many reasons for the lockout included disagreements on resolving the financial struggles of teams like the Penguins and the Ottawa Senators, which had filed for bankruptcy protection. During the lockout, the Penguins' players dispersed between the club's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and to European leagues.","The Penguins struggled financially and struggled to attract fans in the late 2000s, leading to a series of trades and changes in management, including the selection of Marc-Andre Fleury and Evgeni Malkin in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft."
"Change came for the Penguins on October 18, 2006, when Evgeni Malkin made his NHL debut. He set the modern NHL record with a goal in each of his first six games. Malkin would record points in 16 consecutive games. The Penguins finished the 2006–07 season in fifth place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 47–24–11, totaling 105 points, only two points behind the Atlantic Division winners, the New Jersey Devils. It was the franchise's first 100-point season in 11 years and represented an enormous 47-point leap from the previous season. In the first round of the 2007 playoffs the eventual Stanley Cup runners-up, the Ottawa Senators, defeated the Penguins 4–1. At the season's end, rookies Malkin and Jordan Staal were finalists for the Calder Memorial Trophy, awarded to the Rookie of the Year, which Malkin won.
On March 13, 2007, Pennsylvania's Governor Ed Rendell, Allegheny County Chief Executive Dan Onorato, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Mario Lemieux of the Penguins ownership group announced an agreement had been reached among the parties to build the long-sought arena. The state-of-the-art, multi-purpose facility, the Consol Energy Center, guaranteed that the Penguins would remain in the city of Pittsburgh. Following the announcement of the plan, the Lemieux ownership group announced they no longer had plans to sell the team. On June 8, 2007, a $325 million bond was issued, and the Penguins signed a 30-year lease on September 19, binding them to the city of Pittsburgh through 2040.
After a mediocre start to the 2007–08 season, Crosby and starting goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury were both injured long-term due to high right ankle sprains. In their absence, the team flourished because of the play and leadership of Malkin. On April 2, 2008, the Penguins clinched the Atlantic Division title—their first division title in 10 years—with a 4–2 win against rivals the Philadelphia Flyers. Malkin finished the season with 106 points for second place in the league and finished as a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy. The team launched into their first extended playoff run in many years, beating Ottawa 4–0, defeating the New York Rangers 4–1 and then defeating the Philadelphia Flyers 4–1 to clinch the Prince of Wales Trophy. Pittsburgh lost the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14–6 record. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying Conn Smythe Trophy-winner Henrik Zetterberg (13 goals and 14 assists in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead.

In the 2008–09 season, Malkin won the Art Ross and was again a candidate for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Crosby finished third in League scoring with 33 goals and 70 assists for 103 points, despite missing five games. The Penguins' record dipped mid-season but lifted after Dan Bylsma replaced head coach Therrien. The effect was almost instantaneous, and the Penguins recovered enough to secure home-ice advantage in their first-round match up against the Philadelphia Flyers, whom the Penguins defeated in six games. It took seven games for the Penguins to win the next series against Washington, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they eliminated the Carolina Hurricanes in a four-game sweep. After defeating the Hurricanes, the Penguins earned their second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings, to whom they lost the previous year. After losing Games 1 and 2 in Detroit, like the previous years, the Penguins won Games 3 and 4 in Pittsburgh. Each team won on home ice in Games 5 and 6. In Game 7 in Detroit, Maxime Talbot scored two goals, including the game-winner, as the Penguins won 2–1 to win their third Stanley Cup title. Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.
During the 2009–10 season, Crosby scored 109 points (51 goals and 58 assists) in 81 games, winning the Maurice ""Rocket"" Richard Trophy as the NHL season's leading goalscorer. The Penguins, seeded fourth in the East, began their title defense, defeating the Ottawa Senators in six games. In the next round, the Penguins faced the Montreal Canadiens. The teams swapped wins in the series en route to the decisive Game 7, which the Penguins lost 5–2, ending their season and their tenure at Mellon Arena.","The Penguins won their third Stanley Cup title in 2009, led by Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby."
"In 2010–11, the Penguins played their first game in the Consol Energy Center. On February 11, 2011, the Pittsburgh Penguins–New York Islanders brawl took place. A season-ending concussion suffered by Crosby and a knee injury to Malkin marred the season. The team left early in the playoffs, blowing a 3–1 series lead to Tampa Bay Lightning, with Fleury's goaltending called into question. With Crosby still sidelined with post-concussion syndrome, at the start of the 2011–12 season, Malkin led the Penguins' top line and dominated league scoring. He finished with 50 goals and 109 points as the Penguins earned 51 wins on the season. With Malkin's Art Ross-winning performance, and Crosby's late-season return from injury, the Penguins headed into the 2012 playoffs with high hopes of making a significant Stanley Cup run. However, their cross-state rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers, defeated the highly favored Penguins in six games. Malkin was later awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson award. Following the Penguins' disappointing playoff exit, general manager Ray Shero made changes to the team at the 2012 NHL Entry Draft for the upcoming 2012–13 season.
During the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, the Penguins again fought through serious injury. At the end of the regular season, they finished atop the Eastern Conference, matching up against the New York Islanders in round one. The Penguins defeated the Islanders in six games, with Fleury struggling once again. The team then dispatched the Ottawa Senators in five games before being swept in the Conference Finals by the Boston Bruins, scoring just two goals in the entire four-game sweep. On June 13, 2013, Malkin signed an eight-year contract extension worth an annual average of $9.5 million.

In the 2013–14 season, the Penguins suffered numerous injuries throughout the campaign. Despite the adversity, the Penguins won the realigned, eight-team Metropolitan Division, though the club struggled in the playoffs, requiring six games to defeat the Columbus Blue Jackets, then losing to the New York Rangers in seven games despite leading the series 3–1 after four games. This collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Shero, replacing him on June 6 with Jim Rutherford, the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes. Rutherford's first action as general manager was to fire head coach Dan Bylsma, and on June 25, he announced that Mike Johnston was hired as Bylsma's replacement. In the 2014–15 season, the Penguins led the Metropolitan Division for the first half of the season. However, after losing players to injuries and illnesses, including the mumps, the team fell to fourth in the Division. The Pens lost in five games to the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs. In the off-season, Rutherford traded several players and picks to acquire star winger Phil Kessel.","The Penguins faced numerous injuries and challenges throughout the 2010-11 and 2012-13 seasons, but managed to win the 2013-14 season and signed an eight-year contract extension for Malkin."
"After acquiring Kessel, the Penguins had high expectations for the 2015–16 season. However, by December 12, 2015, the team was barely managing a winning season, posting a 15–10–3 record. The organization fired head coach Mike Johnston, and replaced him with Mike Sullivan, who had previously served as the head coach in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. This move was followed by a series of trades by Jim Rutherford.

The Penguins qualified for the playoffs for the tenth consecutive season. They earned second place in the Metropolitan Division with 104 points. In the playoffs, the Penguins defeated the Rangers in a 4–1 series, the Capitals 4–2 and the Lightning 4–3 to win the Eastern Conference Championship, advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals against the San Jose Sharks. On June 12, 2016, the Penguins defeated the Sharks in a 4–2 series to win their fourth Stanley Cup title. Captain Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.
The Penguins opened their 50th anniversary season in the NHL as defending Stanley Cup champions, raising their commemorative banner on October 13, 2016, in a shootout victory over Washington. The Penguins faced the Columbus Blue Jackets in the opening round of the 2017 playoffs, defeating them in five games. In the second round, they played against their divisional rival, Washington, and faced them for the second-straight year in the same round, winning a seven-game series. In the Conference Finals, the Penguins eliminated the Ottawa Senators in seven games to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they faced the Nashville Predators. The Penguins won the first two games of the finals and then lost the next two matchups before dominating the fifth and the sixth games of the series to win the Stanley Cup for the second straight year. By defending their title, the Penguins became the first team since the 1997–98 Detroit Red Wings to defend their title successfully and the first to do so in the salary cap era.","The Pittsburgh Penguins won their fourth Stanley Cup title in 2016, becoming the first team since the 1997–98 Detroit Red Wings to defend their title successfully in the salary cap era."
"Before the 2017–18 season, the Penguins lost longtime goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft to the Vegas Golden Knights. Nevertheless, the Penguins again qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs with the second division playoff spot, finishing the regular season with 100 points. They defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in the first round in six games, but were defeated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals in six games. In the next season, the Penguins clinched a playoff berth, but were swept by the New York Islanders in the First Round. In the following season, which was shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the team advanced to the 2020 playoffs, but were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens in the Qualifying Round. On February 9, 2021, the Penguins named Ron Hextall as their new general manager, after Jim Rutherford resigned from his post on January 27, because of personal reasons. Brian Burke was hired as president of hockey operations. On February 21, Crosby became the first player to reach 1,000 NHL games for the team. The Penguins won the East Division title, extending their playoff streak to 15 seasons. This became the longest active streak in North American sports as a result of the San Antonio Spurs missing the 2020 NBA playoffs. The 2020–21 season came to an end in Game 6 of the first round of the playoffs against the New York Islanders.
On November 29, 2021, Fenway Sports Group announced its intent to purchase a controlling stake in the Penguins. On December 31, 2021, they officially took over as majority owners of the Penguins.
In the First Round, the Penguins lost in seven games to the New York Rangers despite having a 3–1 series lead. The Game 7 loss marked the first time the Penguins lost a Game 7 on the road in franchise history after going 6–0 the previous six instances.
The 2022–23 season was marked with two milestones for the Penguins. On November 23, 2022, Evgeni Malkin played his 1,000th NHL game, becoming the second player in franchise history to play his 1,000th game in a Penguins uniform. This would be followed up only months later, when teammate Kris Letang would play his 1,000th game as well, on April 2, 2023, despite missing 18 games during the season. However, despite being in a playoff position midway in the season, the Penguins missed the playoffs for the first time since Crosby's rookie season in 2005–06, ending a 16-season playoff streak and resulting in Burke and Hextall's dismissals.","The Pittsburgh Penguins experienced a series of ups and downs in the 2017–18 to 2022–23 seasons, including playoff berths and losses, and saw significant changes in leadership and ownership."
"On June 1, 2023, Kyle Dubas was named the team's new president of hockey operations. On 6 August 2023, the Penguins traded for Norris Trophy winning defensemen Erik Karlsson in a three-team deal also involving the Montreal Canadiens. On February 18, 2024, the Penguins retired the no. 68 of franchise legend Jaromir Jagr in a pregame celebration, with Jagr becoming just the third Penguin to receive the honor. Prior to the NHL Trade Deadline, the Penguins parted ways with longtime and fan favourite forward Jake Guentzel, trading him to the Carolina Hurricanes.  Despite the trades, and a late season playoff push, the Penguins were eliminated from playoff contention for the second consecutive year on the penultimate night of the season after the Red Wings defeated the Montreal Canadiens in overtime while the Capitals defeated the Philadelphia Flyers, clinching the final spot as the second wild card.","The Pittsburgh Penguins traded for Erik Karlsson, retired Jaromir Jagr's jersey, and traded Jake Guentzel before finishing the season without making the playoffs."
"Despite Pittsburgh's long history with hockey and a small but loyal fanbase, the Penguins struggled with fan support early on in its history, at times averaging only 6,000 fans per game when Civic Arena had a seating capacity of over 16,000. Fan support was so low by the team's first bankruptcy that the NHL had no problem with the team being moved, something that would change decades later when the team faced another relocation threat.
While the drafting of Mario Lemieux piqued interest in hockey locally, fans remained skeptical. John Steigerwald, brother of former Penguins broadcaster Paul Steigerwald, noted in his autobiography that upon his arrival at KDKA-TV from WTAE-TV in 1985, the station cared more about the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League than the Penguins. However, Lemieux's play steadily grew the fanbase in the area, which would only be reassured upon the arrival of Sidney Crosby after the team struggled both on the ice and in attendance following the Jaromir Jagr trade.
Today, the Penguins are one of the NHL's most popular teams, especially among American non-Original Six franchises, and are considered second behind the Steelers among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams, taking advantage of both its success and the Pittsburgh Pirates struggles both on and off the field. Especially notable was a 2007 survey done of the four major sports leagues' 122 teams. The Penguins surprised observers by being ranked 20th overall and third among NHL teams, while the Steelers were ranked number one and the Pirates (before the arrival of Andrew McCutchen and that team's turnaround) ranked much lower on the list than its peers. The Penguins' popularity has at times rivaled that of the Steelers at the local level.","The Pittsburgh Penguins have struggled with fan support early in their history but have become one of the NHL's most popular teams today, especially among American non-Original Six franchises."
"Considered by some to be the best rivalry in the NHL, the Philadelphia Flyers–Pittsburgh Penguins rivalry began in 1967 when the teams were introduced in the NHL's ""Next Six"" expansion wave. The rivalry exists both due to divisional alignment and geographic location, as both teams play in Pennsylvania. The Flyers lead the head-to-head record with a 153–98-30 record. However, the Penguins eliminated the Flyers from the playoffs in 2008 and 2009 and were eliminated by them from the playoffs in 2012, strengthening the rivalry. Three years later, the Flyers won the sixth playoff meeting between the clubs to advance to the Conference Semi-finals.
The franchises have met seven times in the playoffs, with the Flyers winning four series (1989 Patrick Division Finals, 4–3; 1997 Eastern Conference Quarter-finals, 4–1; 2000 Eastern Conference Semi-finals, 4–2; and 2012 Eastern Conference Quarter-finals, 4–2) and the Penguins winning three (2008 Eastern Conference Finals, 4–1; 2009 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, 4–2; and 2018 Eastern Conference First Round, 4–2).","The Philadelphia Flyers-Pittsburgh Penguins rivalry is one of the strongest in the NHL, characterized by a history of playoff encounters and geographical proximity."
"The two teams have faced off 11 times in the playoffs, with the Penguins winning nine of the 11 matchups, their two series losses coming in the 1994 and 2018 playoffs. The Penguins defeated the Capitals en route to their five Stanley Cup victories. They have met in a decisive game 7 in the 1992, 1995, 2009 and 2017 playoffs. The NHL's fourth Winter Classic, played on January 1, 2011, at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh showcased this rivalry. The Capitals won the game 3–1. The rivalry can also be seen in the American Hockey League (AHL). Pittsburgh's top farm team is the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and their in-state and biggest rivals are the Capitals' top farm team, the Hershey Bears.","The Penguins and Capitals have had a long-standing rivalry in professional hockey, dating back to the 1990s and featuring multiple playoff encounters and a notable Winter Classic game in 2011."
"When the Penguins made their NHL debut in 1967, the team wore the colors dark blue, light blue and white. The uniforms had the word ""Pittsburgh"" written diagonally down the front of the sweater with three dark blue stripes around the sleeves and bottom. The logo featured a hockey-playing penguin in a scarf over an inverted triangle, symbolizing the Golden Triangle of downtown Pittsburgh. A refined version of the logo appeared on a redesigned uniform in the second season, which removed the scarf and gave the penguin a sleeker look. The circle encompassing the logo was later removed.
The team's colors were originally powder blue, navy blue, and white. The powder blue was changed to royal blue in 1973 but returned in 1977. The team adopted the current black and gold color scheme in 1980 to unify the colors of the city's professional sports teams although, like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Steelers, the shade of gold more closely resembled yellow. The change was not without controversy, as the Boston Bruins protested by claiming to own the rights to the black and gold colors. However, the Penguins cited the colors worn by the now-defunct NHL team the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1920s, as well as black and gold being the official colors of the City of Pittsburgh and its namesake, and obtained permission to use the black and gold colors. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates used old Pittsburgh Police uniforms, beginning the black and gold color tradition in the city.
The Penguins generally wore the black and gold ""skating penguin"" uniform between 1980 and 1992, with a few noticeable changes in the lettering and striping. A gold alternate uniform was worn between 1980 and 1984, and briefly replaced the white uniform for home games in the 1983–84 season.
In the 1992–93 season, the Penguins unveiled new uniforms and introduced the ""flying penguin"" logo, or ""Robopenguin"". The team's away uniforms were a throwback to the team's first season, as they revived the diagonal ""Pittsburgh"" script. In 1995, the team introduced their second alternate jersey, featuring different stripe designs on each sleeve. This jersey proved to be so popular that the team adopted it as their away jersey in 1997. In 2000, the Penguins brought back the ""skating penguin"" logo, but with a ""Vegas gold"" shade, upon releasing its new alternate uniform. After 2002, the ""skating penguin"" was readopted as the primary, though the ""flying penguin"" remained the alternate. A corresponding white version of the ""Vegas gold"" uniforms was introduced, and the 1995–2002 black uniform was retired. When the new jerseys were unveiled for the 2007–08 season league wide, the Penguins made major striping pattern changes and removed the ""flying penguin"" logo from the shoulders.

The Penguins have worn their black jersey at home since the league began the initiative to do so beginning with the 2003–04 NHL season. The team wore their powder blue, 1968–1972 ""throwbacks"" against the Buffalo Sabres in the 2008 NHL Winter Classic. This throwback was supposedly retired with the introduction of a new dark blue third jersey that made its debut at the 2011 NHL Winter Classic. For the 2011–12 season, the 2011 Winter Classic jersey was the team's official third uniform, with the 2008 Winter Classic uniform having been retired. Called the ""Blue Jerseys of Doom"" by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the alternate jerseys were worn when Sidney Crosby sustained a broken jaw and when he suffered a concussion in the 2011 Winter Classic. Evgeni Malkin was also concussed during a game when the Penguins donned the alternate uniforms.
In 2014, the Penguins released their new alternate uniforms. The new black uniforms are throwbacks to the early part of Lemieux's playing career, emulating the uniforms worn by the Penguins' 1991 and 1992 Cup-winning teams. The new alternate uniform featured ""Pittsburgh gold"", the particular shade of gold which had been retired when the Penguins switched to the metallic gold full-time in 2002. The Penguins eventually brought back a white version of the black ""Pittsburgh gold"" alternates, thus retiring the ""Vegas gold"" uniforms they wore from 2000 to 2016. A commemorative patch was added to the uniforms throughout the 2016–17 season to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary. During the 2017 NHL Stadium Series against the archrival Philadelphia Flyers, the Penguins wore a special gold uniform featuring military-inspired lettering, a ""City of Champions"" patch and a variation of the ""skating penguin"" logo. This design served as the basis for the team's third uniform, which was unveiled in the 2018–19 season and was also partly inspired by the early 1980s gold uniforms. The Penguins wore monochrome black uniforms minus the white elements when they faced the Flyers again in the 2019 NHL Stadium Series.
In 2021, the Penguins wore white ""Reverse Retro"" uniforms based on the 1992–97 uniforms. This set replaced the ""flying penguin"" with the alternate ""skating penguin"" logo minus the gold triangle on the shoulders. A black version served as the replacement for the gold alternate uniforms starting in the 2021–22 season. In the 2022–23 season, the Penguins unveiled their second ""Reverse Retro"" uniform, this time featuring a black version of the white ""flying penguin"" uniform they wore from 1992 to 2002.
For the 2023 NHL Winter Classic, the Penguins went with a vintage white uniform with black stripes, and added a gold ""P"" logo as a nod to the NHL Pirates of the late 1920s.",The Penguins have worn their black jersey at home since the league began the initiative to do so beginning with the 2003–04 NHL season.
"The Penguins have their radio home on WXDX-FM and their television home on SportsNet Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Penguins Radio Network consists of a total of 34 stations in four states. Twenty three of these are in Pennsylvania, four in West Virginia, three in Ohio, and three in Maryland. The network also features an FM high-definition station in Pittsburgh.","The Pittsburgh Penguins have a radio network with 34 stations across four states, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Maryland, with an additional FM high-definition station in Pittsburgh."
"Local ABC affiliate WTAE-TV broadcast the Penguins during the 1967–68 season, with station Sports Director Ed Conway handling the play-by-play during both the television and radio broadcasts. He remained the lone play-by-play broadcaster until the completion of the 1968–69 season. Joe Tucker took over for Ed Conway during the 1969–70 season, when WPGH-TV and WTAE-TV split Penguins' broadcasts. WPGH-TV retained the rights to broadcast the Penguins for the 1970–71 season, with Bill Hamilton handing the play-by-play duties. The 1970–71 season was also the first season where the Penguins introduced a color commentator to the broadcast team, with John MacDonald taking the position in the booth.

Mike Lange, who joined the Penguins' broadcast team as a play-by-play announcer on the radio side in 1974–75 became the play-by-play broadcaster for the team at the start of the 1979–80 season. At his side was Terry Schiffauer, who had previously held the position of Penguins' director of public relations and eventually transitioned into color commentator for Sam Nover in 1972–73. Lange and Schiffauer remained a team in the Penguins' broadcast booth until 1984–85, when Schiffauer was replaced by Paul Steigerwald. Lange and Steigerwald remained a constant in the broadcast booth from 1985 until 1999. 
With Steigerwald's departure in 1999, Mike Lange shared the broadcast booth with former Penguins' defenseman Peter Taglianetti. Taglianetti remained in the position for one season before being replaced by Eddie Olczyk. Lange and Olczyk were broadcast partners from 2000 until 2003, when Olczyk left the booth to become the 18th head coach in Penguins' history following the firing of previous head coach Rick Kehoe after the 2002–03 season. With Olczyk's vacancy, the Penguins hired Bob Errey as their new color commentator for the start of the 2003–04 season. Lange and Errey remained in the booth until 2005–06. After 26 seasons in the television broadcast booth, FSN Pittsburgh did not retain Mike Lange. Instead, he was replaced by former broadcast partner Paul Steigerwald, who remained the team's TV play-by-play broadcaster until the 2016–17 season. Lange returned to the radio broadcast booth and holds the position of radio play-by-play announcer, the same position he held with the team in the mid-1970s. Following the 2016–17 season, Steigerwald moved back to the Penguins front office and NHL Network personality Steve Mears was hired as the new television play-by-play announcer starting with the 2017–18 season. Lange retired in the 2021 off-season, with Josh Getzoff being named as his replacement. Phil Bourque serves as the radio color commentator. Before the 2023–24 season, Getzoff moved to the television booth with Mears replacing him on the radio. The Penguins did not retain TV analyst Bob Errey, choosing to go with a rotation of analysts featuring former Penguins Colby Armstrong, Mike Rupp and Phil Bourque. In 2024, Joe Brand replaced Steve Mears on the radio booth after Mears was hired by the Blue Jackets.
Every Penguins game is carried on the AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh network, which is carried by cable providers in most of two states and parts of four others. On October 2, 2023, the network will be purchased by the Penguins and rebranded to SportsNet Pittsburgh. In addition, Fox Sports Ohio simulcasts Penguins hockey in the Cleveland metro area, as well as some parts of Eastern Ohio and Northern Kentucky. Dish Network, Verizon FiOS, and Direct TV each carry the Penguins games on their AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh channel in HD nationally. The Pittsburgh Penguins also receive monthly and sometimes weekly ""game of the week"" national exposure on American networks ESPN, ESPN+, ABC, and TNT, and Canadian networks Sportsnet and CBC. Previously, the Penguins received national TV exposure on Fox, NBC and NBCSN in the U.S., and TSN in Canada.","The Pittsburgh Penguins have had multiple play-by-play broadcasters over the years, including Ed Conway, Joe Tucker, Bill Hamilton, John MacDonald, Mike Lange, Terry Schiffauer, Paul Steigerwald, Bob Errey, and Phil Bourque."
Ryan Mill has been the Penguins’ public address announcer since 2009 when he succeeded John Barbero. Jeff Jimerson has been the team's official anthem singer since 1991 and also served in the same capacity in the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Sudden Death.,"Ryan Mill has been the Penguins' public address announcer since 2009, succeeding John Barbero. Jeff Jimerson has been the team's official anthem singer since 1991 and also appeared in the movie Sudden Death."
"The Penguins called Civic Arena home for over 45 seasons from their inception in 1967. In September 2010, they completed the move to the state-of-the-art Consol Energy Center (now named the PPG Paints Arena). The Penguins also played two ""home"" games in the Cleveland suburb of Richfield, Ohio, in 1992 and 1993 at the Richfield Coliseum (this is not unlike the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA playing an annual pre-season game in Pittsburgh; the Philadelphia 76ers used the Civic Arena as a second home in the early 1970s).

From 1995 to 2015, the IceoPlex at Southpointe in the South Hills suburbs served as the team's practice facility. Robert Morris University's 84 Lumber Arena has served as a secondary practice facility for the team. During the franchise's first pre-season training camp and pre-season exhibition games, the Brantford Civic Centre in Brantford, Ontario, served as its home, and by the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s, the team was using the suburban Rostraver Ice Garden for training.
In August 2015, the Penguins and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) opened the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, combining a new team practice and training facility with a UPMC Sports Medicine treatment and research complex, in suburban Cranberry Township near the interchange between Interstate 79 and Pennsylvania Route 228. The twin rink facility replaced both the IceoPlex at Southpointe and the 84 Lumber Arena as the Penguins' regular practice facility, freeing up the Consol Energy Center for other events on days the Penguins are not scheduled to play.
As with most other NHL arenas, the Penguins make use of a goal horn whenever the team scores a goal at home. It is also played just before the beginning of a home game, and after a Penguins victory. Their current goal horn made by Nathan Manufacturing, Inc. and introduced in 2005 to coincide with Sidney Crosby joining the team, was used at both the Civic Arena and the Consol Energy Center.","The Penguins moved to the PPG Paints Arena in 2010 and have used various facilities including the Civic Arena, IceoPlex, 84 Lumber Arena, Brantford Civic Centre, and UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex since then."
"The Penguins have two minor league affiliates assigned to their team. The Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, their AHL affiliate, have played in Wilkes-Barre Township, Pennsylvania, since 1999.

The Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation conducts numerous community activities to support both youth and families through hockey education and charity assistance.,The Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation supports youth and families through hockey education and charity.
"CC was founded in 1971 by Elizabeth Rockwell Raphael in the belief that contemporary artists had new things to say with traditional materials, and that they needed wider opportunities to exhibit and sell their work.  Since then, CC has organized more than 230 exhibitions and has established a satellite gallery and a permanent collection. CC also offers a range of studio classes, community outreach programs, and a retail store.
Elizabeth “Betty” Rockwell Raphael, who has been called one of the most groundbreaking women in the arts was the first to transform the Pittsburgh arts scene. Before its foundation in 1971, Raphael opened a small art gallery in 1941 making the first modern art gallery Pittsburgh had ever seen. She introduced a new vision of art to the city and created what is now one of the only organizations in the country that focuses solely on craft media.
In 2010, CC was named a ""Champion in Action"" in the community arts category by Citizens Bank and WPXI-TV, and received a $25,000 grant for “offering cutting-edge exhibitions focused on multicultural diversity and non-mainstream art, as well as a range of classes and community outreach programs,” said Ralph J, Papa, Chairman of Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania.
In 2018, CC received the Award of Distinction from American Craft Council. This award recognizes an organization, institution, corporation, or individual who has made significant contributions to the field of craft with a minimum of 25 years of service. CC was the first organization to receive this award in Pittsburgh, PA.","Elizabeth ""Betty"" Rockwell Raphael founded CC in 1971, transforming the Pittsburgh arts scene and focusing on craft media."

"Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name  PITS-bər-ə (similar to Edinburgh).
Pittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:
""Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.""
From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as ""Pittsburg"", though use of the final h was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations. After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the h was reversed. The Pittsburg Press continued spelling the city without an h until 1921.","Pittsburgh was named after British statesman William Pitt, and its name has undergone changes over time."
"The area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans. Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Washington's Landing, formerly Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.: 289","Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) settlement located near present-day Washington's Landing, Lawrenceville, Ohio."
"The first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River. European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.
In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers. During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne. The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named ""Pittsborough"".
During Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.
During this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the ""Manor of Pittsburgh"". Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.
On April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township. William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.
Following the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.","The document provides a comprehensive overview of the history of Pittsburgh, including its founding by European explorers, the French and Indian War, Pontiac's War, and the growth of the city during the American Revolution and beyond."
"The federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.
The War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.
In the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from Germany.
Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom. The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad. Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.
The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.","The document discusses the history of Pittsburgh, including its role as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, its industrial growth during the War of 1812, its development as a city in the 19th century, and the impact of the American Civil War on the city's economy and population."
"In 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.
The Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.
The city suffered severe flooding in March 1936.
The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population. Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century. Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.
During World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort. This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the ""arsenal of democracy"" was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being ""hell with the lid off.""
Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the ""Renaissance,"" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The ""Renaissance II"" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.
In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.","Pittsburgh experienced significant industrial growth and expansion in the early 20th century, leading to a boom in population and economic activity. However, the city faced challenges such as flooding, pollution, and economic decline in the latter half of the century, ultimately shifting its focus towards education, tourism, and services."
"During the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.
In September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.","Pittsburgh experienced economic growth during the late 2000s recession, with housing prices appreciating significantly compared to other cities."
"Downtown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine of which top 500 feet (150 m). The U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest, at 841 ft (256 m). The Cultural District consists of a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River. This district contains many theaters and arts venues and is home to a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a four-block mixed-use ""green"" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers of between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south. It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown.","Downtown Pittsburgh, with its 30 skyscrapers, including the U.S. Steel Tower at 841 ft, is undergoing development with the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's RiverParc project and new residential developments, while also serving as a hub for transportation and education."
"The North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. The area was once known as Allegheny City and operated as its own independent city until 1907, when it was merged with Pittsburgh despite great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for its well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to attractions such as Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, Kamin Science Center, National Aviary, Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory art museum, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, Randyland, Penn Brewery, Allegheny Observatory, and Allegheny General Hospital.","The North Side is a diverse neighborhood in Pittsburgh, featuring historic homes, attractions, and a mix of residential and commercial areas."
"The South Side was once the site of railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. Starting in the late 20th century, the city undertook a Main Street program in cooperation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and supporting new retail. The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination, and the value of homes in the South Side had increased in value by about 10% annually for the 10 years leading up to 2014.  East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues.
In 1993, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development that included a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers. Construction of the development began in 1998. The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005, featuring many stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters.","The South Side, once a site of railyards and dense, inexpensive housing, has undergone significant revitalization through the Main Street program and development of mixed-use projects, including the SouthSide Works steel mill property, which opened in 2005 and features a variety of retail, office, and healthcare facilities."
"The East End of Pittsburgh is home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University, Chatham University, The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History, Phipps Conservatory, and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. It is also home to many parks and public spaces including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods with some apartments and condos, and pedestrian-oriented shopping/business districts. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues. Oakland, heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs. Other East End neighborhoods include Point Breeze, Regent Square, Highland Park, Homewood, Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar, Larimer, East Hills, East Liberty, Polish Hill, Hazelwood, Garfield, Morningside, and Stanton Heights.","The East End of Pittsburgh is a diverse area with numerous educational institutions, cultural attractions, and residential neighborhoods, including universities, museums, parks, and historic sites."
"The West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott.",The West End features Mt. Washington and several residential areas like Sheraden and Elliott.
"Many of Pittsburgh's patchwork of neighborhoods still retain ethnic characters reflecting the city's settlement history. These include:

German: Troy Hill, Mt. Washington, and East Allegheny (Deutschtown)
Italian: Brookline, Bloomfield, Morningside, Oakland
Hispanic/Latino: Beechview/Brookline
Polish, Austrian, Belgian, Czech, Slovak, German, Greek, Hungarian, Luxembourgish, Dutch, Romanian, Swiss, Slovenia and the northern marginal regions of Italy, Croatian, as well as northeastern France, Central European: South Side, Lawrenceville, and Polish Hill
Lithuanian: South Side, Uptown
African American/Multiracial African American: Hill District, Homewood, Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar, Larimer, East Hills, and Hazelwood
Jewish (Ashkenazi): Squirrel Hill
Irish: Mt. Washington, Carrick, Greenfield
Ukrainian (Ruthenian): South Side",Pittsburgh's neighborhoods reflect its diverse ethnic history through various ethnic groups.
"Several neighborhoods on the edges of the city are less urban, featuring tree-lined streets, yards and garages, with a more suburban character. Oakland, the South Side, the North Side, and the Golden Triangle are characterized by more density of housing, walking neighborhoods, and a more diverse, urban feel.","Neighborhoods in the city vary in their urban density and character, with some featuring tree-lined streets and yards, while others are denser with walking neighborhoods and a more diverse urban feel."
"Pittsburgh falls within the borders of the Northeastern United States as defined by multiple US Government agencies. Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Pittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the ""northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia."" In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the ""Paris of Appalachia"", recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.","Pittsburgh is located in the Northeastern United States and Appalachia, known for its industrial heritage and cultural resources."
"The American Lung Association's (ALA) 2023 “State of the Air” report (which included data from 2019 to 2021) showed air quality in Pittsburgh improving. The city received a passing grade for ozone pollution, going from an F to a C grade, and improving from the 46th to 54th most polluted by ozone smog.
According to daily ozone air quality data provided by the EPA, from 2021 to 2024, Pittsburgh had good or moderate air quality most of the time. Then-Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald said in December 2023 that they’d seen an “80 % drop in hazardous air pollutants” and that they made EPA attainment at all eight county air monitors for the first time in 2020, and then also achieved that goal in 2021, 2022, and were on track for better results in 2023.
A past 2019 ""State of the Air"" report from the American Lung Association (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened compared to previous reports, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.
In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas. The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey. The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.
Although the county was still below the ""pass"" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999. ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated ""It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more.""
As of 2005, the city includes 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.
Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects. In a past study conducted between 2014 and 2016 researchers determined that children who lived in areas close to sources of pollution, such as industrial sites, experienced rates of asthma at almost 3 times the national average. The study also found that 38% of students live in areas over USEPA's 12 micrograms per cubic meter standards, while 70% live in areas over the WHO's standard of 10 micrograms per cubic meter. Several of the plants were located in or very near Pittsburgh. The study also noted that most of the effected communities were minority communities. This had led some residents in Pittsburgh to believe that the continuing effects of air pollution are a case of environmental racism.
Groups such as Women for a Healthy Environment are working to address ongoing concerns surrounding air pollution in Pittsburgh. WHE does work such as policy analysis, publishing reports, and community education. In the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.","Pittsburgh's air quality improved significantly from 2019 to 2021, with ozone pollution decreasing from an F to a C grade and moving from 46th to 54th most polluted by ozone smog."
"The local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits. This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959. Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water. As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers. Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations. The local sewage authority, Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions. In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which was approved by the EPA in 2019.
Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement. In 2017, Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority. Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).
PWSA has also been subject to criticism due to findings released in 2016 showing high levels of lead in Pittsburgh's drinking water. Although Pittsburgh's drinking water had been high in lead levels, and steadily rising, for many years, many residents blame PWSA administrative changes for the spike in lead levels. In the years prior, PWSA had hired Veolia, a Paris-based company, for consultation to help with mounting administrative difficulties. By 2015, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had laid off 23 people, including halving the laboratory staff that was responsible for testing water safety and quality. Simultaneously, PWSA in consultation with Veolia had changed what chemicals they were using to prevent metal corrosion in 2014, from soda ash to caustic soda, without consulting with Department of Environmental Protection. Anti-corrosive chemicals were being used because many of Pittsburgh's water pipes were made of lead, and adding anti-corrosive chemicals helped prevent lead from seeping into drinking water.
In 2016 lead levels were as high as 27 ppb in some cases. The legal limit is 15 ppb, although there is not a safe amount of lead in drinking water. Though lead levels had been rising in previous years, they had not exceeded the legal limit. In late 2015 PWSA terminated its contracted with Veolia. In response to the high lead levels PWSA began adding orthophosphate to the water. Orthophosphate is meant to create a coating on the inside of pipes, creating a barrier to prevent lead from leaching into drinking water. PWSA has also been working to replace lead pipes, and continuing to test water for lead.
There remains concern among residents over the long-term effects of this lead, particularly for children, in whom lead causes permanent damage to the brain and nervous system. Some people also believe that the high levels of lead reflect environmental racism, as black and Hispanic children in Pittsburgh experience elevated blood-lead levels at 4 times the rate of white children. Water fountains in Langley k-8 school in Sheraden were found to have the highest levels of lead of any schools in the Pittsburgh area. These levels were about 11 times the legal limit. Some residents believe this is due to Langely being a predominantly black school, with 89% of the student body being eligible for the free lunch program.","Pittsburgh's water and sewage systems face significant pollution and contamination issues due to outdated infrastructure and inadequate upgrades, leading to public health concerns and legal challenges."
"At the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race. Non-Hispanic whites were 64.8% of the population in 2010, compared to 78.7% in 1970. By the 2020 census, the population slightly declined further to 302,971. Its racial and ethnic makeup in 2020 was 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, 5.8% Asian, and 3.2% Hispanic or Latino American of any race.
Since the beginning of the 21st century, the five largest European ethnic groups in Pittsburgh were German (19.7%), Irish (15.8%), Italian (11.8%), Polish (8.4%), and English (4.6%), while the metropolitan area is approximately 22% German-American, 15.4% Italian American and 11.6% Irish American. Pittsburgh has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation, and the fifth-largest Ukrainian community per the 1990 census. Pittsburgh has one of the most extensive Croatian communities in the United States. Overall, the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country.
Pittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.
According to a 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) study, residents include 773,341 ""Catholics""; 326,125 ""Mainline Protestants""; 174,119 ""Evangelical Protestants;"" 20,976 ""Black Protestants;"" and 16,405 ""Orthodox Christians,"" with 996,826 listed as ""unclaimed"" and 16,405 as ""other"" in the metro area. A 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University estimated the Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh was 49,200. Pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor to Jehovah's Witnesses was founded by Charles Taze Russell; today the denomination makes up approximately 1% of the population based on data from the Pew Research Center.
According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 32% professing Catholic beliefs. while 18% claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make up about 4% of the population.

In 2010, there were 143,739 households, out of which 21.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 31.2% were married couples living together, 16.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.4% were non-families. 39.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95.
In the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.
The median income for a household in the city was $28,588, and the median income for a family was $38,795. Males had a median income of $32,128 versus $25,500 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,816. About 15.0% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.5% of those under the age of 18 and 13.5% ages 65 or older. By the 2019 American Community Survey, the median income for a household increased to $53,799. Families had a median income of $68,922; married-couple families had a median income of $93,500; and non-family households had a median income of $34,448. Pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs within city limits are Squirrel Hill and Point Breeze, the only two areas of the city which have average household incomes over $100,000 a year. Outside of city limits, Sewickley Heights is by a wide margin the wealthiest suburb of Pittsburgh within Allegheny County, with an average yearly household income of just over $218,000. Sewickely Heights is seen as one of Pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs culturally as well, titles which the suburbs of Upper St. Clair, Fox Chapel, Wexford, and Warrendale also have been bestowed.
In a 2002 study, Pittsburgh ranked 22nd of 69 urban places in the U.S. in the number of residents 25 years or older who had completed a bachelor's degree, at 31%. Pittsburgh ranked 15th of the 69 places in the number of residents 25 years or older who completed a high school degree, at 84.7%.
The metro area has shown greater residential racial integration during the last 30 years. The 2010 census ranked 18 other U.S. metros as having greater black-white segregation, while 32 other U.S. metros rank higher for black-white isolation.
As of 2018, much of Pittsburgh's population density was concentrated in the central, southern, and eastern areas. The city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile; its most densely populated parts are North Oakland (at 21,200 per square mile) and Uptown Pittsburgh (at 19,869 per square mile). Outside of the city limits, Dormont and Mount Oliver are Pittsburgh's most densely-populated neighborhoods, with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively.
Most of Pittsburgh's immigrants are from China, India, Korea and Italy.","The 2010 census showed a 8.6% decrease in the population of Pittsburgh, with 66.0% being White, 25.8% Black or African American, and 4.4% Asian. The city's population slightly declined further to 302,971 in 2020, with 64.7% non-Hispanic white, 23.0% Black or African American, and 5.8% Asian."
"Since the 1940s, some demographic changes have sometimes been caused by city initiatives for redevelopment.
Throughout the 1950s Pittsburgh's Lower Hill District faced massive demographic changes when 1,551, majority black, residents and 413 businesses were forced to relocate when the city of Pittsburgh used eminent domain to make space for the construction of the Civic Arena. This Civic Arena ultimately opened in 1961. The Civic Arena was built as part of one of Pittsburgh's revitalization campaigns. An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950. Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now. These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena.
In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.
Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as “Florida’s creative class.” This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment “We had an inspired and shared vision.” When describing the result of redevelopment he said “East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for.”
The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of “deconcentration,” an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place. Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification. Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.","Demographic changes in Pittsburgh's Lower Hill District and East Liberty were caused by government-led redevelopment initiatives, leading to displacement and gentrification."
"Pittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007, and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies. A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility or the American Dream. Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square. Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots. Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as ""the poster child for managing industrial transition"". Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.
The largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 48,000 employees. All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs in the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: ""That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s.""

 Education is a major economic driver in the region. The largest single employer in education is the University of Pittsburgh, with 10,700 employees.
Ten Fortune 500 companies call the Pittsburgh area home. They are (in alphabetical order):  Alcoa Corporation (NYSE: AA), Arconic Corporation (NYSE: ARNC), Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS),  The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ: KHC), PNC Financial Services (NYSE: PNC), PPG Industries (NYSE: PPG), U.S. Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), Viatris (NASDAQ: VRTS), Wabtec Corporation (NYSE: WAB), and WESCO International (WYSE: WCC).

There is also concern regarding the effectiveness of law enforcement in solving these cases, as 97% of unsolved cases involved a black victim. This has led certain residents to believe law enforcement to be ineffective or apathetic. This is despite an increasing police budget. In 2023, members of the Pittsburgh City Council approved an increase to the police budget by $6 million. About 6% of this money is expected to go to the Stop the Violence trust fund. This fund goes to improving parks and recreation, various non-profits, and to the office of Community Health and Safety, in effort to holistically improve the social pressures supposedly causing violence in Pittsburgh.
Some people do not believe these efforts to be adequate. Certain studies, such as conducted by the Police Scorecard, rate the Pittsburgh Police Department at 37% quality (with 100% being the best). They rated Pittsburgh below the 50th percentile in the categories “police budget cost per person,” “fines / forefeitures,” “Police Presence/Over-Policing (Officers per Population),” “Force Used per Arrest,” “Racial Disparities in Deadly Force,” “Excessive Force Complaints Upheld,” “Discrimination Complaints Upheld,” “Criminal Misconduct Complaints Upheld,” “Arrest Rate for Low Level Offenses,” and “Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests.” This is 10 out of 15 categories.","Pittsburgh is considered one of the safest big cities in America, but its homicide rate for African Americans is seven times higher than the national average, and some residents believe law enforcement is ineffective or apathetic."

"Pittsburgh's 116-year-old film industry accelerated after the 2006 passage of the Pennsylvania Film Production Tax Credit. According to the Pittsburgh Film Office, over 124 major motion pictures have been filmed, in whole or in part, in Pittsburgh, including The Mothman Prophecies, Wonder Boys, Dogma, Hoffa, The Silence of the Lambs, Sudden Death, Flashdance, Southpaw, Striking Distance, Mrs. Soffel, Jack Reacher, Inspector Gadget, The Next Three Days, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, and Fences. Pittsburgh became ""Gotham City"" in 2011 during filming of The Dark Knight Rises. George A. Romero shot nearly all his films in the area, including his Living Dead series.
Film production in Pittsburgh has notably impacted the region's economy and job creation, largely due to the 25% tax credit incentive established in 2007. The Pittsburgh Film Office states that the film and television industry provides employment to over 10,000 people and pays over $500 million in wages in southwestern Pennsylvania. Furthermore, the industry supports over 345,000 local businesses and contributes over $41 billion to them.
From 2017 to 2023, Pittsburgh has welcomed a series of major film and television productions like Fences, Mindhunter, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Sweet Girl, and I'm Your Woman.

"The August Wilson Center was part of a plan drawn up by Pittsburgh NAACP President Tim Stevens in 1996 in order to try to bring the National NAACP Convention to Pittsburgh. In the plan, there was a statement that urged the Mayor of Pittsburgh to provide financial backing for an African American Museum. Later in 1996, then-Mayor Tom Murphy charged two City Council Members, Sala Udin and Valerie McDonald with bringing stakeholders together to discuss the museum's future. Funding from various sources, including the URA, State of Pennsylvania, and The Heinz Endowments came together to begin construction of the center. The land on which the center sits was taken by eminent domain and sold to the museum for $1. The center celebrated its ""topping off"" ceremony on August 12, 2008, at 12:30 pm. Construction was completed shortly thereafter and the museum was open to the full public on September 17 and 19, 2009.
The August Wilson Center was designed under the direction of Allison G. Williams, FAIA and members of her team from her San Francisco office of Perkins and Will. During the design of this project, AI merged with MBT Architecture and then was subsequently bought by Perkins+Will. The project design was completed in the San Francisco office of Perkins+Will. Team members included Greg Lehman, Sally Curtis, Stacie Velten.
In February 2019, the August Wilson Center for African American Culture (the center's original name) changed its name to the August Wilson Cultural Center, and the following month, to the August Wilson African American Cultural Center (the latter change, following an online petition objecting to the deletion of ""African American"" from its name).","The August Wilson Center for African American Culture was built in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with funding from various sources, including the URA, State of Pennsylvania, and The Heinz Endowments, and was designed by Allison G.

"The center struggled to pay off its construction debt from 2012, on January 20, 2014, a federal bankruptcy official reported that the center's debt situation might be irreversible. Subsequently, a federal court ruled on January 27, 2014, that the center's liquidation could begin to pay off debts.
In February 2014 concerned stakeholders started a website to raise funds for the center. After numerous court cases, the center was sold at a sheriff's sale on November 3, 2014, to the mortgage holder, Dollar Bank  for $1,912.50.
On November 5, 2014 Dollar Bank sold the center to a nonprofit consortium for $7.9 million. The consortium included contributions from private foundations: $2.45 million from the Heinz Endowments, $2.35 million from the Richard King Mellon Foundation, $500,000 from the Pittsburgh Foundation and $500,000 from the Thomas Tull Family Foundation. Public sources contributed another $3.15 million: $1.65 million from the Urban Redevelopment Authority and $1.5 million from the Allegheny Regional Asset District.
The court-appointed conservator had originally agreed to sell the building for $9.5 million to a private developer, 980 Liberty Partners, who had planned to build a hotel on top of the center. Pittsburgh Major Bill Peduto, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and the URA fought the bid. 980 Liberty Partners withdrew in a September 2014 settlement that favored the consortium of local foundations. 980 Liberty partners was reimbursed $360,000 from URA's share of the purchase price.
By 2019, the center was on a solid financial foundation, having ended 2018 with a budget surplus and was building a capital reserve. By 2020, the center was showing additional signs of recovery, having increased its operating budget to $7.25 million from $1.77 million in 2015 and increased the percentage of the budget coming from earned income to 17% from 5%. The center had greatly increased its individual donor base and held substantially more events.","The center was sold to a nonprofit consortium in November 2014, raising $7.9 million from various foundations, including the Heinz Endowments, Richard King Mellon Foundation, Pittsburgh Foundation, and Thomas Tull Family Foundation."

"The main structure of Salk Hall is the former city owned Pittsburgh Municipal Hospital for Contagious Diseases constructed in 1941 on land the university had given to the city.  It was designed by Richard Irving and Theodore Eicholz. The hospital was built as a project by President Roosevelt's Public Works Administration. The 225-bed hospital was originally part of the Medical Center associated with the University and was intended to be used primarily to treat communicable diseases. However, when antibiotics virtually eliminated the need to quarantine patients, the building had become a financial burden on the city.  Therefore, in September 1949, work began on remodeling the building, and it temporarily housed Pitt's School of Public Health. In October 1957, the Municipal Hospital was formally acquired from the city for $1.3 million ($14.1 million today) and renamed Jonas Salk Hall.  For a time, the upper floors of the building served as a residence for students.  Pitt remodeled it to house the School of Dental Medicine and School of Pharmacy in 1961-1962.","The document describes the history and transformation of Salk Hall, a former hospital on the University of Pittsburgh campus, including its construction, use as a public health facility, and subsequent changes in its purpose and use."
"The Salk Hall Annex, a major renovation and three-story addition designed by the architectural firm Deeter, Ritchey, and Sippel for the Dental School, was completed the Terrace Street side of the building in 1967 for a cost of over $5 million ($48.3 million today).  Today, it serves as a main entrance for Salk Hall and the dental clinics.
A new $50.6 million ($71 million today) addition and renovation to Salk Hall was announced in January 2010. It will include the construction of an 80,000-square-foot (7,400 m2) research tower in the parking area behind the existing building by Ballinger Architects with associates DRS Architects. The new tower is planned to house laboratories and support spaces relocated from their current home in Salk Hall in order to free up space for additional classrooms and offices in the original structure. The target completion date is July, 2014.","The Salk Hall Annex was completed in 1967 and serves as a main entrance for Salk Hall and dental clinics. A new $50.6 million addition and renovation to Salk Hall is planned, including a 80,000-square-foot research tower."
"A dental museum is housed in the first floor reception area of Salk Hall. The museum contains a variety of original dental artifacts, including a c. 1910 dental chair, and x-ray machine and instrument cabinet from the 1920s.",A dental museum in Salk Hall features artifacts from the early 20th century.
"Also contained in Salk Hall is the Elmer H. Grimm Sr. Pharmacy Museum, which opened in the fall of 1996.  Located on the fourth floor, the museum holds pharmacy memorabilia such as drug products, equipment, and sundry products dating back to the early 20th century.  Among the museum's possessions are two hand-carved finials, which were often found over the door or partitions that separated the main part of the pharmacy from the back room where pharmacists did most of their work, an old-fashioned powder mill, and a konseal machine.","The Elmer H. Grimm Sr. Pharmacy Museum, located in Salk Hall, features pharmacy memorabilia including drug products, equipment, and historical artifacts dating back to the early 20th century."
"Bloomfield is a plateau above the Allegheny River; it is bordered by Penn Avenue on the north, the East Busway on the south, 40th Street on the west, and Gross Street on the east. This last boundary is somewhat disputed – many residents believe that Bloomfield abuts the neighborhood of Friendship at Gross Street. Here the provincial frame rowhouses give way to stand-alone brick Victorian homes, which were built larger on each street heading east. The City of Pittsburgh, however, claims that Bloomfield extends east as far as Graham Street.
The East Busway is set into Skunk Hollow, a ravine that separates Bloomfield from Polish Hill to the west, North Oakland to the southwest, and Shadyside to the south. The neighborhoods are within sight of one another and are connected by the Bloomfield Bridge and the South Millvale Bridge, both of which span this gap.","Bloomfield is a neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, bordered by various streets and highways, with its eastern boundary disputed."
"The Bloomfield neighborhood has 4 distinct flights of city steps - all of which are open and in a safe condition. In Bloomfield, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians from the main residential area to the lower-elevation streets of Lorigan, Juniper, and Neville. These shady streets offer a mix of residential and industrial buildings and are popular with dog walkers, runners, and cyclists.","The document describes the four distinct city steps in Bloomfield, connecting pedestrians to lower-elevation streets with residential and industrial buildings."
"Bloomfield does not appear to have been an independent borough prior to its annexation by the City of Pittsburgh in 1868.  Casper Taub sold the land to his son-in-law John Conrad Winebiddle, whose descendants divided it into lots and sold it for development beginning around the time of the 1868 annexation. The community most likely was named for the abundant blooming flowers near the original town site.
In the decades following 1868, Bloomfield was settled by German Catholic immigrants, who in 1886 built St. Joseph's Church. Beginning around 1900, Italians from five towns in the Abruzzi region settled here, forming Immaculate Conception Parish in 1905 (that church was rebuilt in its present form in 1961). Descendants from both groups, with ethnic Italians outnumbering the Germans, still give the neighborhood its character today. In 2001 the national churches of St. Joseph's and Immaculate Conception were merged to form a single parish.
Since the early 21st century, Bloomfield is one of the neighborhoods that has attracted young adults, including those described as creative and ""hip."" Pittsburgh's affordability and ethnic history, compared to some other cities, have resulted in new residents settling here.","Bloomfield, annexed by Pittsburgh in 1868, was settled by German Catholic and Italian immigrants, leading to the formation of St. Joseph's and Immaculate Conception parishes."
"The business district is concentrated along Liberty Avenue, with a variety of businesses and services. In addition to the two churches and Western Pennsylvania Hospital, the street has many restaurants and bars, a supermarket and italian market, tanning and hair salons, gift and card shops, gyms, two barber shops, a cobbler, a smoke shop, a vacuum repairman, and more. A small park beside the Bloomfield Bridge holds public bocce courts, a playground, a softball field, a skateboarding area, and a dek hockey rink.","The document describes the business district along Liberty Avenue in Pittsburgh, including various establishments and amenities."
"Baltimore Colts' Hall of Fame quarterback, Pittsburgh native Johnny Unitas returned to this neighborhood to play. After being cut by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1955, Unitas played one season for the semipro Bloomfield Rams on Dean's Field, located under the Bloomfield Bridge. The semipro league has long since folded, and the Bloomfield Rams no longer exist. The former Dean's Field was renamed as Officer Paul J. Sciullo Memorial Field, after a policeman killed in duty. It is now part of a public recreational complex.",Johnny Unitas played football in Baltimore in 1955 before the semipro Bloomfield Rams team.
"This historic building was conceived by the Grand Army of the Republic during the 1890s as a way for Pittsburgh and Allegheny County residents to honor the dwindling ranks of American Civil War veterans; it was built on what had served as a Union Army mustering ground during the war. The memorial now represents all branches of the service and honors career and citizen soldiers who have served the United States throughout its history.
Architect Henry Hornbostel designed this memorial in 1907. Dedicated in 1910, the building was created in the Beaux-Arts style and is heroic in scale. It is located in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh at 4141 Fifth Avenue (although the walkway leading to its main entrance is signed as ""Matthew Ridgway Blvd."" in honor of the World War II and Korean War hero who called Pittsburgh home). Situated adjacent to the University of Pittsburgh campus and its Cathedral of Learning, the building is set back from Fifth Avenue. It features expansive, well-kept lawns with large cannons and other war implements. The side streets flanking the building are Bigelow Boulevard and University Place, with O'Hara Street directly behind the memorial.
It houses rare and one-of-a-kind exhibits that span the eras from the American Civil War to present-day conflicts. Since 1963, it has been home to the ""Hall of Valor,"" an exhibit that honors individual veterans from the region who went above and beyond the call of duty. The hall currently pays tribute to more than six hundred honorees, including winners of the Medal of Honor, The Kearny Cross, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Navy Cross, the Air Force Cross, the Silver Star, and the Distinguished Flying Cross.
The building houses an auditorium that seats 2,500, a banquet hall, meeting rooms, and a museum. The expansive lawn of the memorial sits on top of an underground parking garage operated under a long-term lease by the University of Pittsburgh.
It has served as host for many city, civic, university, and business events, including an April 25, 1978, Gulf Oil Corporation shareholders meeting.",The Grand Army of the Republic Memorial in Pittsburgh is a historic Beaux-Arts-style monument dedicated to honoring American Civil War veterans and those who have served throughout U.S. history.
"The 1991 psychological horror film Silence of the Lambs features the hall as the Memphis Courthouse, where the film's villain, Hannibal Lecter is kept in a makeshift cell.

"The orchestra was founded by the Pittsburgh Arts Society with conductor Frederic Archer in 1895, who brought with him a number of musicians from the Boston Symphony Orchestra and led the PSO in its first concert the following year.
In 1898, Victor Herbert was chosen to lead the orchestra. The orchestra traveled at a more frequent rate under Herbert's tenure, performing in Boston, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Canada. Its personnel included such musicians as Luigi von Kunits (later the first conductor of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra) as concertmaster, first violinist Frederick William Stahlberg, second violinist John Stepan Zamecnik, assistant principal cello Gaston Borch, Paul Henneberg as first flute, and Leon Medaer as first clarinet.
Herbert composed two orchestral works that the Pittsburgh Orchestra premiered: his Suite romantique op. 31 (which he also dedicated to the orchestra) and the tone poem Hero and Leander op. 33. Under Herbert's direction, the Pittsburgh Orchestra played as part of the Pan-American Exposition at the 1901 World's Fair in Buffalo, New York, for which Herbert had also composed an original work for the exhibition titled ""Panamericana: Morceau Characteristique"" for the Orchestra to perform.  His tenure with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra ended in 1904 because of increasingly strident disagreements with the orchestra's manager, George H. Wilson, who disliked Herbert's populist manner and personally despised him. 
When Herbert left the orchestra in 1904, the Symphony Society chose as his successor Austrian conductor Emil Paur.  Paur took an intellectual approach to his work and avoided theatrics.  Trained as a violinist, he had served as conductor of both the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, as well as guest conductor throughout Europe, and held the Pittsburgh Orchestra to the same exacting standards.  Paur's programs emphasized the classical repertoire and increased the presence of works by Johannes Brahms, whose music was considered too challenging for most audiences at that time. Additionally, Paur clashed with many of the orchestra's musicians when he prohibited them from accepting outside performing engagements and continued to hire mainly European musicians.  Orchestra manager George H. Wilson resigned on December 24, 1906, shortly after the beginning of Paur's third season, saying that his tenure, pride, and pleasure with the orchestra:

""...have all constrained me during the past two years to bear with the personal idiosyncracies, the superficiality of his musical faith, the narrowness of his musical horizon, his indifference to the success of the out-of-town concerts, the hazard (to the orchestra business) of an uncontrolled temper, the frequent distrust of my motives, and the peculiar and ever-shifting focus of the stupidity of the present conductor...these things are characteristic of the man, not passing symptoms.""
Paur remained at the head of the orchestra until it disbanded in 1910.","The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1895 and underwent several changes in leadership, including Frederic Archer, Victor Herbert, and Emil Paur, before eventually disbanding in 1910."
"In the interim, concert promoter May Beegle founded the Pittsburgh Orchestra Association to bring other musical performers to the city.
Antonio Modarelli, an American conductor and composer, became conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphonic Orchestra in 1930. A German newspaper described his conducting as ""forceful, authentic, modern music"", and he was invited to conduct in Moscow. He had taught at Duquesne University and been a band leader in the Navy prior to his work in Europe and with the Symphony.
This program of frequent guest conductors was made in an effort to restore the symphony to its ""golden years,"" but in effect demoted Modarelli, who was finally asked by the Board to resign in 1936.
Otto Klemperer was responsible for bringing in much new talent while working with the Musicians' Union to hire both local and imported performers. Since then, the orchestra has experienced ongoing growth and development, including building a substantial endowment fund.","The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra was founded by May Beegle to bring other musical performers to the city, but Antonio Modarelli's tenure as conductor was eventually ended due to a lack of support from the board."
"Fritz Reiner was music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1938 to 1948.  Reiner studied with Hungarian composer Béla Bartók and programmed many of Bartók's works in Pittsburgh Symphony performances.
Women joined the orchestra for the first time during World War II. Eighteen women joined in 1942, and 24 more women joined in 1944. The PSO had more female performers than any other major American symphony during the war.
Victor De Sabata came to Pittsburgh in 1948, in part because of the urgings of his colleague Vladimir Bakaleinikoff, whom he had conducted in Cincinnati in 1927. Ticket sales increased with de Sabata at the helm. He was so popular with local audiences that around 1,200 people attended a concert he conducted at the Syria Mosque during one of Pittsburgh's worst snowstorms.  He returned to conduct the orchestra in 1949, 1950, and 1951. The orchestra established a Guest Conductor Chair in his name in 2010.","Fritz Reiner was the music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony from 1938 to 1948, and he programmed many of Béla Bartók's works in Pittsburgh Symphony performances.

De Sabata was so popular with local audiences that around 1,200 people attended a concert he conducted during one of Pittsburgh's worst snowstorms."
"William Steinberg became the orchestra's music director in 1952.  During the early part of the 1950s, the Symphony played a number of ""industry concerts"", conducted by Steinberg and sponsored by area industries, specifically the United Steelworkers of America. The sponsorship offset costs for industry workers, and the Symphony performed in more convenient locations throughout Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. The Symphony continued to bring music to smaller communities in partnership with Manufacturers Heat and Light Company and Columbia Gas during the Steinberg era.
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra performed for audiences in Warsaw, Madrid, Berlin, Zagreb, Reykjavik, and 15 other locations throughout Europe and the Middle East during the State Department tour.
Many of the orchestra's earlier recordings were made in the Syrian Mosque with labels such as Capitol Records and Columbia Records. The Pittsburgh Symphony performed at the Syria Mosque from 1926 until 1971. The building was torn down in 1992.
Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony made several recordings for the Command label starting in 1962.  These recordings were made at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Pittsburgh.  The technical superiority of the Command recordings was aided by the company's use of 35mm film as the recording medium.
Steinberg conducted his final Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concerts as music director in 1976, after which he returned for guest-conducting appearances as music director emeritus.","William Steinberg served as the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra's music director from 1952 to 1976, conducting numerous concerts and recordings during his tenure."
"André Previn succeeded Steinberg as music director in 1976.  Previn had a collegial working style with symphony musicians and even formed a chamber music trio with Herbert Greenberg, associate concertmaster, and principal cellist Anne Martindale Williams around 1979. In 1981, Previn renewed his contract with the symphony orchestra.
During this time, Victoria Bond served as an affiliate conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra from 1978 to 1980. Bond was the first woman to earn a doctoral degree in orchestral conducting from the Juilliard School and is a prolific composer.  While at the Pittsburgh Symphony, she also served as the music director of the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony and the New Amsterdam Symphony in New York City.
Previn often brought jazz to the concert hall. In February 1977, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Previn made their national debut on PBS with eight specials, Previn and the Pittsburgh. The Alcoa Foundation sponsored the Emmy-nominated program, which ran for three years. Guests on the program included John Williams, Ella Fitzgerald, and Oscar Peterson.
Previn left the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 1984, but is credited with ""renewing the stature of the orchestra, expanding its position in the community, and giving the city a positive image internationally…""","André Previn succeeded Steinberg as music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 1976 and continued to work with the orchestra until 1984, bringing jazz to the concert hall and revitalizing the orchestra's reputation."
"Lorin Maazel became music consultant to the orchestra in 1984.  In 1985, the orchestra elevated Maazel's title to music adviser and principal guest conductor.  In 1988, Maazel became music director of the orchestra.  Maazel announced in 1995 his intention to stand down music director of the orchestra in 1996, to focus on composition. In addition to developing his compositional work, Maazel went on to direct and conduct the New York Philharmonic, along with several orchestras abroad. After his death in July 2014, the Pittsburgh Symphony performed memorial pieces for Maazel as well as created a multimedia exhibit featuring Symphony archival materials related to the late director.
Marvin Hamlisch served as principal pops conductor beginning in 1995 until his death in 2012.",Marvin Hamlisch was the principal pops conductor from 1995 to 2012.
"A capital campaign was launched in 1993 to increase the Pittsburgh Symphony's endowment by $70 million.
On April 10, 1995, the orchestra announced the appointment of Mariss Jansons to succeed Maazel in 1996 as its eighth music director. Latvian–born Jansons was well received by critics and audiences in Pittsburgh, who applauded the ""warmth and humanity"" that he brought to the ensemble.  In addition to directing the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, Jansons also served as an influential music director for the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra in Norway until 2002.  With Jansons, the Pittsburgh Symphony toured all over the world, introducing it to new audiences, and recorded extensively. During this time, the Symphony was ""innovative in drawing new elements of the Pittsburgh region’s population to concerts in Heinz Hall and elsewhere."" Jansons conducted his last year as music director of the Symphony during the 2003–2004 season, after which he began acting as director of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in Munich.
The Pittsburgh Symphony under Gilbert Levine was joined by the London Philharmonic Choir, Kraków Philharmonic Choir, Ankara Polyphonic Choir, and members of the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh in a program that included the world premiere of ""Abraham,"" a sacred motet by John Harbison, and Mahler Symphony No. 2 ""Resurrection. The event, which was attended by the Pontiff, Rav Elio Toaff, Imam Abdulawahab Hussein Gomaa, and 7,000 invited guests, was telecast on RAI, on PBS, and throughout the world, and released on DVD by WQED Multimedia, Pittsburgh. Subsequent to this concert, at Levine's impetus, the Pittsburgh Symphony founded a series of concerts entitled ""Music for the Spirit."" He led the first two of these performances of the Haydn ""Creation and Mahler Symphony No. 3 in Pittsburgh in 2006.","The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra was led by Maestro Mariss Jansons from 1996 to 2003, during which time they toured extensively and recorded extensively, while also establishing a series of concerts entitled ""Music for the Spirit."""
"With the 2005–2006 season, the PSO introduced a different model for artistic leadership. During this time, a new collective bargaining agreement was in effect, which gave the musicians increased authority over matters of running the orchestra, such as the hiring of musicians and choice of repertoire. Starting in 2005, Sir Andrew Davis served as the PSO artistic advisor, with Yan Pascal Tortelier as principal guest conductor and Marek Janowski holding the ""endowed guest conductor chair.""
Sir Andrew Davis, while providing overall programming input regarding the entire season and leading the orchestra in a variety of styles, paid special attention to the music of British and American composers. Davis had been an organ scholar before becoming a conductor. Under his direction, the Symphony performed many symphonic, operatic, and choral works ranging from baroque to contemporary. Davis, a Knight Bachelor of Great Britain and music director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, had previously led the Pittsburgh Symphony several times as a guest conductor between 1977 and 1990.
Davis was originally scheduled to step down after the 2007–2008 season, but in October 2007, Davis and the Pittsburgh Symphony mutually agreed to terminate his contract early and for him not to conduct his scheduled concerts in the 2007–2008 season because of increased demands on Davis' schedule. The contracts of Tortelier and Janowski also expired in 2008. Janowski now holds the Otto Klemperer Guest Conductor Chair with the PSO.","The 2005-2006 season saw the introduction of a new artistic leadership model for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, with Sir Andrew Davis serving as the artistic advisor, Yan Pascal Tortelier as principal guest conductor, and Marek Janowski holding the ""endowed guest conductor chair."""
"In May 2006, Manfred Honeck first guest-conducted the PSO.  He returned for another guest appearance in November 2006.  In January 2007, the PSO announced the appointment of Manfred Honeck as its ninth music director, effective with the 2008–2009 season, in a reversion of conductor leadership format to the traditional music director hierarchy. His initial contract was for three years.  In September 2009, the PSO announced the extension of Honeck's contract to the 2015–2016 season. In February 2012, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck's contract through the 2019–2020 season.  In June 2007, the orchestra announced the appointment of American conductor Leonard Slatkin as the orchestra's principal guest conductor for the 2008–2009 season.
In November 2006, the PSO announced a pledge of $29.5 million from the Richard P. Simmons family as the start of a capital challenge for the orchestra to address long-standing financial concerns. In December 2006, the PSO announced the launch of an $80 million capital fund-raising drive after the initial $29.5 million boost from the Simmons family. In March 2009, the PSO announced the discontinuation of its chamber orchestra series after the 2008–2009 season, along with staff reductions of 9 positions.
In September 2009, the Pittsburgh Symphony and Honeck agreed to extend his contract through the 2015–2016 season.  In February 2012, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck's contract through the 2019–2020 season.  In September 2018, the PSO announced the further extension of Honeck's contract through the 2021–2022 season. In September 2021, the PSO announced the newest extension of Honeck's contract as music director through the 2027–2028 season.","The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra has had a long-standing relationship with conductor Manfred Honeck, who has been appointed as its ninth music director and has extended his contract multiple times, including through the 2027–2028 season."

"Launched in 1977, ""Previn and the Pittsburgh"" was a series of specials produced by WQED-TV. The Alcoa Foundation sponsored the programs, which ran for three years and became the highest rated classical music series on PBS. The program showcased the diversity of Music Director Andre Previn's musical interests, talents and friends.

Others featured guest artists John Williams, conducting his music from ""Star Wars"" and ""E.T.,"" Ella Fitzgerald, Yo-Yo Ma, Pittsburgh Symphony principal cello Nathaniel Rosen (the first American cellist to win the gold medal at the Tchaikovsky International Competition), composer Stephen Sondheim and violinist Itzhak Perlman. Composer Miklos Rosza appeared as a guest to hear the Pittsburgh Symphony play his Oscar-winning score for the movie ""Ben-Hur."" Previn displayed his considerable talent as a jazz pianist in a duet with his friend Oscar Peterson, the man Duke Ellington dubbed ""the maharajah of the keyboard."" When cameras came into Heinz Hall to film the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra rehearsing in their shirtsleeves, audiences saw a relaxed maestro in bellbottoms who obviously liked and respected the musicians. The first show aired on February 27, 1977, and within two days the Pittsburgh Symphony sold more than 2,500 additional seats.","The ""Previn and the Pittsburgh"" series, produced by WQED-TV in 1977, featured diverse musical performances by Andre Previn and the Pittsburgh Symphony, including collaborations with guest artists and showcasing Previn's jazz piano skills."
"Launched in 1982, the Pittsburgh Symphony Radio program is hosted by Jim Cunningham of WQED-FM. It is a complete two-hour concert with Music Director Manfred Honeck and guest artists heard on over 100 PRI and NPR stations across the country. The Pittsburgh Symphony was first broadcast in 1936 when NBC Blue Network began a series of 26 half-hour radio broadcasts over the NBC Blue Network of more than 90 stations. The broadcasts were sponsored by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company.","The Pittsburgh Symphony Radio program, hosted by Jim Cunningham, has been airing since 1982 and features concerts with Music Director Manfred Honeck and guest artists on over 100 NPR and PRI stations nationwide."
"A $10-million reconstruction of the theater took place between 1967 and 1971. Although much of the structure and décor remained the same, a new five-story wing was added to the back of the building. This wing expanded the stage and rehearsal space along with the music library and dressing rooms.
Several concerts took place before the remodel and reopening of the Hall in 1971, including a performance of works by Berlioz, Beethoven and Brahms by the Leonard Rose, Isaac Stern and Eugene Istomin Trio for the 1969 pension fund concert. Questionnaires filled out by symphony followers were collected after the concert and reflected an overwhelming support of the new venue.
Heinz Hall was dedicated in September 1971. The inaugural concerts took place on September 10 and 11 with William Steinberg conducting Beethoven's ""Consecration of the House"" overture and Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (""Resurrection"") with a combined chorus of Pennsylvania State University choirs. The New York Times published an outstanding review of the performances, citing the improvement of the acoustics over previous Symphony venues saying, ""Pittsburghers at last have the opportunity to hear (the orchestra) as it ought to sound.""
The Garden Plaza and a four-story addition to the Hall were completed in 1982 by the firm of MacLachlan, Cornelius & Filoni. The plaza included a waterfall and sculpture by London-based artist Angela Connor. The addition to the Hall included two bar/lounge spaces as well as a dining and meeting room. In addition, some public areas were refurbished into reception facilities in 1988.
A $6.5-million renovation began in 1995 with funding provided by the Howard Heinz Endowment and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Strategy 21 program funds. The renovation improved the acoustical, technical and aesthetic qualities of the Hall and was carried out by Architect Albert Filoni, of MacLachlan, Cornelius & Filoni, along with acoustician R. Lawrence Kirkegaard.  The Hall reopened with a ribbon cutting ceremony by Governor Tom Ridge and Teresa Heinz.","The $10 million reconstruction of Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh, completed in 1971, significantly improved the acoustics, technical, and aesthetic qualities of the venue, leading to widespread acclaim and a dedicated audience."
"For thousands of years, Native Americans inhabited the region where the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date. During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound at the future site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5 km) from the head of the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.
By 1700 the Haudenosaunee, the Five Nations-based south of the Great Lakes in present-day New York, held dominion over the upper Ohio valley, reserving it for hunting grounds.  Other tribes included the Lenape, who had been displaced from eastern Pennsylvania by European settlement, and the Shawnee, who had migrated up from the south. With the arrival of European explorers, these tribes and others had been devastated by infectious diseases from Europe, such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and malaria, to which they had no immunity.

In 1748, when Conrad Weiser visited Logstown, 18 miles (29 km) downriver from Pittsburgh, he counted 789 warriors gathered: the Iroquois included 163 Seneca, 74 Mohawk, 35 Onondaga, 20 Cayuga, and 15 Oneida. Other tribes were 165 Lenape, 162 Shawnee, 100 Wyandot, 40 Tisagechroami, and 15 Mohican.
Shannopin's Town, a Lenape (Delaware) village on the east bank of the Allegheny, was established in the 1720s and was deserted after 1758. The village is believed to have been roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.: 289 
Sawcunk, on the mouth of the Beaver River, was a Lenape settlement and the principal residence of Shingas, a chief of theirs. Chartier's Town was a Shawnee town established in 1734 by Peter Chartier. Kittanning was a Lenape and Shawnee village on the Allegheny, with an estimated 300–400 residents.","The document provides a historical overview of Native American tribes inhabiting the Ohio Valley region, including the Haudenosaunee, Lenape, Shawnee, and others, and their interactions with European explorers and settlers."
"The first Europeans arrived in the 1710s as traders. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a manuscript in 1717, and later that year European traders established posts and settlements in the area.
Europeans first began to settle in the region in 1748, when the first Ohio Company, a Virginian land speculation company, won a grant of 200,000 acres (800 km2) in the upper Ohio Valley. From a post at present-day Cumberland, Maryland, the company began to construct an 80-mile (130 km) wagon road to the Monongahela River employing a Lenape Indian chief named Nemacolin and a party of settlers headed by Capt. Michael Cresap to begin widening the track into a road. It mostly followed the same route as an existing Native American trail now known as Nemacolin's Trail. The river crossing and flats at Redstone creek, was the earliest point and shortest distance for the descent of a wagon road. Later in the war, the site fortified as Fort Burd (now Brownsville) was one of several possible destinations. Another alternative was the divergent route that became Braddock's Road a few years later through present-day New Stanton. In the event, the colonists did not succeed in turning the path into a wagon road much beyond the Cumberland Narrows pass before they came into conflict with Native Americans. The colonists later mounted a series of expeditions in order to accomplish piecemeal improvements to the track.
The nearby Native American community of Logstown was an important trade and council center in the Ohio Valley. Between June 15 and November 10, 1749, an expedition headed by Celeron de Bienville, a French officer, traveled down the Allegheny and Ohio to bolster the French claim to the region. De Bienville warned away British traders and posted markers claiming the territory.
In 1753, Marquis Duquesne, the Governor of New France, sent another, larger expedition. At present-day Erie, Pennsylvania, an advance party built Fort Presque Isle. They also cut a road through the woods and built Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, from which it was possible at high water to float to the Allegheny. By summer, an expedition of 1,500 French and Native American men descended the Allegheny. Some wintered at the confluence of French Creek and the Allegheny. The following year, they built Fort Machault at that site.
Alarmed at these French incursions in the Ohio Valley, Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent Major George Washington to warn the French to withdraw. Accompanied by Christopher Gist, Washington arrived at the Forks of the Ohio on November 25, 1753.

Proceeding up the Allegheny, Washington presented Dinwiddie's letter to the French commanders first at Venango, and then Fort Le Boeuf. The French officers received Washington with wine and courtesy, but did not withdraw.
Governor Dinwiddie sent Captain William Trent to build a fort at the Forks of the Ohio. On February 17, 1754, Trent began construction of the fort, the first European habitation at the site of present-day Pittsburgh. The fort, named Fort Prince George, was only half-built by April 1754, when over 500 French forces arrived and ordered the 40-some colonials back to Virginia. The French tore down the British fortification and constructed Fort Duquesne.
Governor Dinwiddie launched another expedition. Colonel Joshua Fry commanded the regiment with his second-in-command, George Washington, leading an advance column. On May 28, 1754, Washington's unit clashed with the French in the Battle of Jumonville Glen, during which 13 French soldiers were killed and 21 were taken prisoner. After the battle, Washington's ally, Seneca chief Tanaghrisson, unexpectedly executed the French commanding officer, Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville. The French pursued Washington and on July 3, 1754, George Washington surrendered following the Battle of Fort Necessity. These frontier actions contributed to the start of the French and Indian War (1754–1763), or, the Seven Years' War, a global confrontation between Britain and France fought in both hemispheres.

In 1755, the Braddock Expedition was launched, accompanied by Virginia militia officer George Washington. Two regiments marched from Fort Cumberland across the Allegheny Mountains and into western Pennsylvania. Following a path Washington surveyed, over 3,000 men built a wagon road 12 feet (3.7 m) wide, that when complete, was the first road to cross the Appalachian Mountains. Braddock's Road, as it was known, blazed the way for the future National Road (US40). The expedition crossed the Monongahela River on July 9, 1755. French troops from Fort Duquesne ambushed Braddock's expedition at Braddock's Field, nine miles (14 km) from Fort Duquesne. In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French inflicted heavy losses on the British, and Braddock was mortally wounded. The surviving British and colonial forces retreated. This left the French and their Native American allies with dominion over the upper Ohio valley.
On September 8, 1756, an expedition of 300 militiamen destroyed the Shawnee and Lenape village of Kittanning, and in the summer of 1758, British Army officer John Forbes began a campaign to capture Fort Duquesne. At the head of 7,000 regular and colonial troops, Forbes built Fort Ligonier and Fort Bedford, from where he cut a wagon road over the Allegheny Mountains, later known as Forbes' Road. On the night of September 13–14, 1758, an advance column under Major James Grant was annihilated in the Battle of Fort Duquesne. The battleground, the high hill east of the Point, was named Grant's Hill in his memory. With this defeat, Forbes decided to wait until spring. But when he heard that the French had lost Fort Frontenac and largely evacuated Fort Duquesne, he planned an immediate attack. Hopelessly outnumbered, the French abandoned and razed Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on November 25, 1758, and ordered the construction of Fort Pitt, named after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between the rivers, ""Pittsborough"" (see Etymology of Pittsburgh). The British garrison at Fort Pitt made substantial improvements to its fortification. The French never attacked Fort Pitt and the war soon ended with the Treaty of Paris and French defeat. They ceded their territories east of the Mississippi River.","The document provides a chronological overview of European exploration and settlement in the Ohio Valley, including the establishment of forts, roads, and settlements, and the conflicts with Native Americans."
"In 1760, the first considerable European settlement around Fort Pitt began to grow. Traders and settlers built two groups of houses and cabins, the ""lower town,"" near the fort's ramparts, and the ""upper town,"" along the Monongahela as far as present-day Market Street. In April 1761, a census ordered by Colonel Henry Bouquet and conducted by William Clapham counted 332 people and 104 houses.: 148 
After Britain's victory in the French and Indian War, increasing dissatisfaction among Native Americans with the continuing encroachment of settlers on lands that had been agreed would be Indian-occupied (both in the 1758 Treaty of Easton and in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 the British authorities had decreed that there would be no British-American settlements west of the Alleghenies, but the authorities had been unable or unwilling to enforce these decrees) led to the outbreak of Pontiac's War. The Odawa leader Pontiac launched an offensive against British forts in May 1763. Native American tribes from the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes overran numerous British forts; one of their most important targets was Fort Pitt. Receiving warning of the coming attack, Captain Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss officer in command of the garrison, prepared for a siege. He leveled the houses outside the ramparts and ordered all settlers into the fort: 330 men, 104 women, and 196 children sought refuge inside its ramparts. Captain Ecuyer also gathered stores, which included hundreds of barrels of pork and beef. Pontiac's forces attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and the siege of Fort Pitt lasted for two months. Pontiac's warriors kept up a continuous, though ineffective, fire on it from July 27 through August 1, 1763. They drew off to confront the relieving party under Colonel Bouquet, which defeated them in the Battle of Bushy Run. This victory ensured British dominion over the forks of the Ohio, if not the entire Ohio valley. In 1764 Colonel Bouquet added a redoubt, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse, which still stands, the sole remaining structure from Fort Pitt and the oldest authenticated building west of the Allegheny Mountains.

The Iroquois signed the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands south of the Ohio to the British Crown. European expansion into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English-American, another third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others. These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but often their households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles. Settlers had to deal with harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.
Increasing violence, especially by the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the Revolutionary War, as some hoped that the war would end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.
With the war still ongoing, in 1780 Virginia and Pennsylvania came to an agreement on their mutual borders, creating the state lines known today and determining finally that the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh region was Pennsylvanian. In 1783, the Revolutionary War ended, which also brought at least a temporary cessation of border warfare. In the 1784 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Iroquois ceded the land north of the Purchase Line to Pennsylvania.

After the Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building. Flatboats could be used to carry large numbers of pioneers and goods downriver, while keelboats were capable of traveling upriver.
The village began to develop vital institutions. Hugh Henry Brackenridge, a Pittsburgh resident and state legislator, introduced a bill that resulted in a gift deed of land and a charter for the Pittsburgh Academy on February 28, 1787. The academy later developed as the University of Western Pennsylvania (1819) and since 1908 has been known as the University of Pittsburgh.
Many farmers distilled their corn harvest into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey was used as a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.
The town continued to grow in manufacturing capability. In 1792, the boatyards in Pittsburgh built a sloop, Western Experiment. During the next decades, the yards produced other large boats. By the 19th century, they were building ocean-going vessels that shipped goods as far as Europe. In 1794, the town's first courthouse was built; it was a wooden structure on Market Square. In 1797, the manufacture of glass began.","Fort Pitt was a significant European settlement established in 1760, growing into a bustling community with houses and cabins near the fort's ramparts and along the Monongahela River. The settlement faced challenges during Pontiac's War in 1763, with the fort being besieged and eventually captured by Native American forces. After the war, European expansion into the Ohio valley increased, and by 1770, thousands of settlers had arrived, primarily English-American, Scotch-Irish, and German. The settlers faced harsh winters and frequent conflicts with Native Americans, who often raided their settlements. The town's growth was marked by the development of vital institutions like the Pittsburgh Academy and the construction of the first courthouse. Manufacturing capabilities also expanded, with boatbuilding and glass production becoming prominent industries."
"Commerce continued to be an essential part of the economy of early Pittsburgh, but increasingly, manufacture began to grow in importance. Pittsburgh was located in the middle of one of the most productive coalfields in the country; the region was also rich in petroleum, natural gas, lumber, and farm goods. Blacksmiths forged iron implements, from horse shoes to nails. By 1800, the town, with a population of 1,565 persons, had over 60 shops, including general stores, bakeries, and hat and shoe shops.
The 1810s were a critical decade in Pittsburgh's growth. In 1811, the first steamboat was built in Pittsburgh. Increasingly, commerce would also flow upriver. The War of 1812 catalyzed growth of the Iron City. The war with Britain, the manufacturing center of the world, cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American manufacture. In addition, the British blockade of the American coast increased inland trade, so that goods flowed through Pittsburgh from all four directions. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing $764K in iron; $249K in brass and tin, and $235K in glass products. When, on March 18, 1816, Pittsburgh was incorporated as a city, it had already taken on some of its defining characteristics: commerce, manufacture, and a constant cloud of coal dust.
Other emerging towns challenged Pittsburgh. In 1818, the first segment of the National Road was completed, from Baltimore to Wheeling, bypassing Pittsburgh. This threatened to render the town less essential in east–west commerce. In the coming decade, however, many improvements were made to the transportation infrastructure. In 1818, the region's first river bridge, the Smithfield Street Bridge, opened, the first step in developing the ""City of bridges"" over its two rivers. On October 1, 1840, the original Pennsylvania Turnpike was completed, connecting Pittsburgh and the eastern port city of Philadelphia. In 1834, the Pennsylvania Main Line Canal was completed, making Pittsburgh part of a transportation system that included rivers, roads, and canals.
Manufacture continued to grow. In 1835, McClurg, Wade and Co. built the first locomotive west of the Alleghenies. Already, Pittsburgh was capable of manufacturing the most essential machines of its age. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the mountains. In 1841, the Second Court House, on Grant's Hill, was completed. Made from polished gray sandstone, the court house had a rotunda 60 feet (18 m) in diameter and 80 feet (24 m) high.

Like many burgeoning cities of its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped some of its necessary infrastructure, such as a water supply with dependable pressure. Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a great fire burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages. As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City (present-day North Side). In 1854, the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
Despite many challenges, Pittsburgh had grown into an industrial powerhouse. An 1857 article provided a snapshot of the Iron City:

939 factories in Pittsburgh and Allegheny City
employing more than 10K workers
producing almost $12M in goods
using 400 steam engines
Total coal consumed — 22M bushels
Total iron consumed — 127K tons
In steam tonnage, third busiest port in the nation, surpassed only by New York City and New Orleans.","Pittsburgh experienced significant growth in commerce and manufacture during the 1810s, becoming a major industrial center by the 1840s."
"Ingham (1978) examined the leadership of the industry in its most important center, Pittsburgh, as well as smaller cities. He concludes that the leadership of the iron and steel industry nationwide was ""largely Scotch Irish"". Ingham finds that the Scotch Irish held together cohesively throughout the 19th century and ""developed their own sense of uniqueness.""
New immigrants after 1800 made Pittsburgh a major Scotch-Irish stronghold. For example, Thomas Mellon (b. Ulster 1813–1908) left northern Ireland in 1823 for the United States. He founded the powerful Mellon family, which played a central role in banking and industries such as aluminum and oil. As Barnhisel (2005) finds, industrialists such as James Laughlin (b. Ulster 1806–1882) of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company comprised the ""Scots-Irish Presbyterian ruling stratum of Pittsburgh society.""","The document discusses the leadership of the iron and steel industry in Pittsburgh and its connection to the Scotch-Irish community, highlighting the influence of immigrants from Ulster on the development of the industry and the establishment of prominent families like the Mellon and Laughlin families."
"In 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke-fire smelting to the region. The American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry. Arms manufacture included iron-clad warships and the world's first 21"" gun. By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh. A milestone in steel production was achieved in 1875, when the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock began to make steel rail using the new Bessemer process.
Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew W. Mellon, and Charles M. Schwab built their fortunes in Pittsburgh. Also based in Pittsburgh was George Westinghouse, credited with such advancements as the air brake and founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886). Banks played a key role in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. For example, T. Mellon & Sons Bank, founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.
Ingham (1991) shows how small, independent iron and steel manufacturers survived and prospered from the 1870s through the 1950s, despite competition from much larger, standardized production firms. These smaller firms were built on a culture that valued local markets and the beneficial role of business in the local community. Small firms concentrated on specialized products, particularly structural steel, where the economies of scale of larger firms were no advantage. They embraced technological change more cautiously than larger firms. They also had less antagonistic relations with workers and employed a higher percentage of highly skilled workers than their mass-production counterparts.","Pittsburgh experienced significant growth during the American Civil War due to increased production of iron and armaments, leading to the production of over half of the steel and one-third of all U.S. glass."
"Beginning in the 1870s, entrepreneurs transformed the economy from small, craft-organized factories located inside the city limits to a large integrated industrial region stretching 50 miles across Allegheny County. The new industrial Pittsburgh was based on integrated mills, mass production, and modern management organization in steel and other industries. Many manufacturers searched for large sites with railroad and river accessibility. They purchased land, designed modern plants, and sometimes built towns for workers. Other firms bought into new communities that began as speculative industrial real estate ventures. Some owners removed their plants from the central city's labor unions to exert greater control over workers. The region's rugged topography and dispersed natural resources of coal and gas accentuated this dispersal. The rapid growth of steel, glass, railroad equipment, and coke industries resulted in both large mass-production plants and numerous smaller firms. As capital deepened and interdependence grew, participants multiplied, economies accrued, the division of labor increased, and localized production systems formed around these industries. Transportation, capital, labor markets, and the division of labor in production bound the scattered industrial plants and communities into a sprawling metropolitan district. By 1910 the Pittsburgh district was a complex urban landscape with a dominant central city, surrounded by proximate residential communities, mill towns, satellite cities, and hundreds of mining towns.
Representative of the new industrial suburbs was the model town of Vandergrift, according to Mosher (1995).  Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A  strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.","The document discusses how the industrialization of Pittsburgh in the late 19th century led to the creation of new suburban communities, such as Vandergrift, designed by Frederick Law Olmsted to provide a harmonious environment for workers and promote loyalty among steelworkers."
Christopher Magee and William Flinn operated powerful Republican machines that controlled local politics after 1880. They were business owners and favored business interests. Flinn was a leader of the Progressive movement statewide and supported Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election.,"Christopher Magee and William Flinn were influential Republican politicians who controlled local politics after 1880, favoring business interests and supporting Theodore Roosevelt."
"During the mid-19th century, Pittsburgh witnessed a dramatic influx of German immigrants, including a brick mason whose son, Henry J. Heinz, founded the H.J. Heinz Company in 1869. Heinz was at the forefront of reform efforts to improve food purity, working conditions, hours, and wages, but the company bitterly opposed the formation of an independent labor union.","The H.J. Heinz Company was founded by a German immigrant brick mason who worked to improve food purity and working conditions, but opposed the formation of an independent labor union."
"As a manufacturing center, Pittsburgh also became an arena for intense labor strife. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, Pittsburgh workers protested and had massive demonstrations that erupted into widespread violence, known as the Pittsburgh Railway Riots. Militia and federal troops were called to the city to suppress the strike. Forty men died, most of them workers, and more than 40 buildings were burned down, including the Union Depot of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Strikers also burned and destroyed rolling stock: more than 100 train engines and 1000 railcars were destroyed. It was the city with the most violence of any affected by the strikes.

In 1892, a confrontation in the steel industry resulted in 10 deaths (3 detectives, 7 workers) when Carnegie Steel Company's manager Henry Clay Frick sent in Pinkertons to break the Homestead Strike.  Labor strife continued into the years of the Great Depression, as workers sought to protect their jobs and improve working conditions. Unions organized H.J. Heinz workers, with the assistance of the Catholic Radical Alliance.","The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and the Homestead Strike of 1892 were significant labor conflicts in Pittsburgh, resulting in violence and destruction of property."
"Andrew Carnegie, an immigrant from Scotland and a former Pennsylvania Railroad executive turned steel magnate, founded the Carnegie Steel Company. He proceeded to play a key role in the development of the U.S. steel industry. He became a philanthropist: in 1890, he established the first Carnegie Library, in a program to establish libraries in numerous cities and towns by the incentive of matching funds. In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced. He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.
The third (and present) Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail was completed in 1886. In 1890, trolleys began operations. In 1907, Pittsburgh annexed Allegheny City, which is now known as the North Side.","Andrew Carnegie, an immigrant steel magnate, established the Carnegie Steel Company and became a philanthropist, founding libraries, trusts, and foundations. He also played a role in the development of the U.S. steel industry and the construction of the Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail."
"During the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was a hotbed of bootlegging and illicit alcohol consumption. Several factors fed into resistance to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption. The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade.
During that time, Prohibition Administrator John Pennington and his federal agents engaged in 15,000 raids, arrested over 18,000 people and closed down over 3,000 distilleries, 16 regular breweries, and 400 'wildcat' breweries. Even the term ""Speakeasy,"" meaning an illegal drinking establishment, is said to have been coined at the Blind Pig in nearby McKeesport, Pennsylvania.
The last distillery in Pittsburgh, Joseph S. Finch's distillery, located at South Second and McKean streets, closed in the 1920s. In 2012, Wigle Whiskey opened, becoming the first since the closure of Finch's distillery.
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette produced a large web feature on this period in the city's history.","The Prohibition era in Pittsburgh led to significant crackdowns on illegal alcohol trade, resulting in the closure of many distilleries and the opening of Wigle Whiskey in 2012."
"During the late 19th century, city leaders debated the responsibility and expense of creating a waterworks system and disposal of sewage. Downstream users complained about Pittsburgh's dumping of sewage into the Ohio River. Allegheny County cities did not stop discharging raw sewage into rivers until 1939. Pittsburgh's smoke pollution, seen in the 1890s as a sign of prosperity, was recognized as a problem in the Progressive Era and was cleared up in the 1930s–1940s. Steel plants deposited mountains of slag until 1972, especially in Nine Mile Run Valley.
In November 1927, 28 people were killed and hundreds were wounded in an explosion of a gas tank.
To escape the soot of the city, many of the wealthy lived in the Shadyside and East End neighborhoods, a few miles east of downtown. Fifth Avenue was dubbed ""Millionaire's Row"" because of the many mansions lining the street.
On March 17 and 18, 1936, Pittsburgh suffered the worst flood in its history, with flood levels peaking at 46 feet. This catastrophe killed 69 victims, destroyed thousands of buildings, caused $3B (2006 dollars) in damages, and put more than 60,000 steelworkers out of work.","Pittsburgh faced environmental challenges including sewage disposal, pollution from steel plants, and flooding during the late 19th and early 20th centuries."
"Oakland became the city's predominant cultural and educational center, including three universities, multiple museums, a library, a music hall, and a botanical conservatory. Oakland's University of Pittsburgh erected what today is still the world's fourth-tallest educational building, the 42-story Cathedral of Learning. It towered over Forbes Field, where the Pittsburgh Pirates played from 1909 to 1970.","Oakland was once a major cultural and educational hub, home to several prominent institutions including the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning, which was the tallest educational building in the world at its time."
"Between 1870 and 1920, the population of Pittsburgh grew almost sevenfold, with a large number of European immigrants arriving to the city. New arrivals continue to come from Britain, Ireland, and Germany, but the most popular sources after 1870 were poor rural areas in southern and eastern Europe, including Italy, the Balkans, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Russian Empire. Unskilled immigrants found jobs in construction, mining, steel mills and factories. They introduced new traditions, languages, and cultures to the city, creating a diversified society as a result. Ethnic neighborhoods developed in working-class areas and were built on densely populated hillsides and valleys, such as South Side, Polish Hill, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill, home to 28% of the city's almost 21,000 Jewish households. The Strip District, the city's produce distribution center, still boasts many restaurants and clubs that showcase these multicultural traditions of Pittsburghers.","The document discusses the growth of Pittsburgh's population between 1870 and 1920, with a focus on the influx of European immigrants, particularly from southern and eastern Europe, who settled in ethnic neighborhoods and introduced new traditions and cultures to the city."
"The years 1916–1940 marked the largest migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh during the Great Migration from the rural South to industrial cities of the Northeast and Midwest. These migrants came for industrial jobs, education, political and social freedom, and to escape racial oppression and violence in the South. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns faced racial discrimination and restricted housing and job opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities.
Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process:

Although African-Americans often expressed their views of the Great Migration in biblical terms and received encouragement from northern black newspapers, railroad companies, and industrial labor agents, they also drew upon family and friendship networks to help in the move to Western Pennsylvania. They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.
The newly established Black communities nearly all endured, apart from Johnstown where blacks were expelled in 1923. Joe Trotter explains how the Blacks built new institutions for their new communities in the Pittsburgh area:

Black churches, fraternal orders, and newspapers (especially the Pittsburgh Courier); organizations such as the NAACP, Urban League, and Garvey Movement; social clubs, restaurants, and baseball teams; hotels, beauty shops, barber shops, and taverns, all proliferated.
The cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh was Wylie Avenue in the Hill District. It became  an important jazz mecca because jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Billy Strayhorn and Earl Hines played there. Two of the Negro League's greatest baseball rivals, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays, often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated the Negro National League in the 1930s and 1940s.","The Great Migration of African Americans to Pittsburgh from the 1910s to the 1940s led to significant growth in the black population, with many taking skilled jobs in steel mills. New communities were built, and cultural institutions flourished, including jazz clubs and baseball teams."
"Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold starting in the 1880s, and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for their votes. But the Great Depression starting in 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.
Joseph Guffey, statewide leader of the Democrats, and his local lieutenant David Lawrence gained control of all federal patronage in Pittsburgh after Roosevelt's landslide victory in 1932 and the election of a Democratic mayor in 1933. Guffey and Lawrence used the New Deal programs to increase their political power and build up a Democratic machine that superseded the decaying Republican machine. Guffey acknowledged that a high rate of people on relief was not only ""a challenge"" but also ""an opportunity."" He regarded each relief job as Democratic patronage.","Pittsburgh's shift from Republican to Democratic dominance in the 1930s was driven by the Great Depression, the New Deal Coalition, and the increasing popularity of Democratic relief and job programs among ethnic voters."
"Pittsburgh was at the center of the ""Arsenal of Democracy"" that provided steel, aluminum, munitions and machinery for the U.S. during World War II. Pittsburgh's mills contributed 95 million tons of steel to the war effort. The increased production output created a workforce shortage, which resulted in African Americans moving en masse during the Second Great Migration from the South to the city in order to find work.","Pittsburgh played a crucial role in the U.S. war effort during World War II by producing steel and other materials, leading to a significant increase in workforce demand and the migration of African Americans from the South to the city."
"David Lawrence, a Democrat, served as mayor of Pittsburgh from 1946 to 1959 and as Pennsylvania's governor from 1959 to 1963. Lawrence used his political power to transform Pittsburgh's  political machine into a modern governmental unit that could run the city well and honestly.  In 1946  Lawrence decided to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 because he believed smoke abatement was crucial for the city's future economic development. However, enforcement placed a substantial burden on the city's working-class because smoky bituminous coal was much less expensive than smokeless fuels. One round of protests came from Italian-American organizations, which called for delay in enforcing it. Enforcement raised their cost of living and threatened the jobs of their relatives in nearby bituminous coal mines. Despite dislike of the smoke abatement program, Italian Americans strongly supported the reelection of Lawrence in 1949, in part because many of them were on the city payroll.","David Lawrence, a Democrat, used his political power to enforce the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 in Pittsburgh, despite opposition from Italian-American organizations who feared job losses and higher costs."
"Rich and productive, Pittsburgh was also the ""Smoky City,"" with smog sometimes so thick that streetlights burned during the day as well as rivers that resembled open sewers.  Civic leaders, notably Mayor David L. Lawrence, elected in 1945, Richard K. Mellon, chairman of Mellon Bank and John P. Robin began smoke control and urban revitalization, also known as Urban Renewal projects that transformed the city in unforeseen ways.
""Renaissance I"" began in 1946.  Title One of the Housing Act of 1949 provided the means in which to begin.  By 1950, vast swaths of buildings and land near the Point were demolished for Gateway Center. 1953 saw the opening of the (since demolished) Greater Pittsburgh Municipal Airport terminal.
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the lower Hill District, an area inhabited predominantly by poor Blacks, was completely destroyed. Ninety-five acres of the lower Hill District were cleared using eminent domain, forcibly displacing hundreds of small businesses and more than 8,000 people (1,239 black families, 312 white), to make room for a cultural center that included the Civic Arena, which opened in 1961. Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.
In the early 1960s, the neighborhood of East Liberty was also included in Renaissance I Urban Renewal plans, with over 125 acres (0.51 km2) of the neighborhood being demolished and replaced with garden apartments, three 20-story public housing apartments, and a convoluted road-way system that circled a pedestrianized shopping district.  In the span of just a few years during the mid-1960s, East Liberty became a blighted neighborhood. There were some 575 businesses in East Liberty in 1959, but only 292 in 1970, and just 98 in 1979.
Preservation efforts by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, along with community neighborhood groups, resisted the demolition plans.  The neighborhoods containing rich architectural heritage, including the Mexican War Streets, Allegheny West, and Manchester, were spared. The center of Allegheny City, with its culturally and socially important buildings, was not as lucky. All of the buildings, with the exception of the Old U.S. Post Office, the Carnegie Library, and Buhl Planetarium were destroyed and replaced with the ""pedestrianized"" Allegheny Center Mall and apartments.
The city's industrial base continued to grow in the post-war era partly assisted by the area's first agency entirely devoted to industrial development, the RIDC. Jones and Laughlin Steel Company expanded its plant on the Southside. H.J. Heinz, Pittsburgh Plate Glass, Alcoa, Westinghouse, U.S. Steel and its new division, the Pittsburgh Chemical Company and many other companies also continued robust operations through the 1960s. 1970 marked the completion of the final building projects of Renaissance I: the U.S. Steel Tower and Three Rivers Stadium. In 1974, with the addition of the fountain at the tip of the Golden Triangle, Point State Park was completed. Although air quality was dramatically improved, and Pittsburgh's manufacturing base seemed solid, questions abound about the negative effects Urban Renewal continues to have on the social fabric of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh, however, was about to undergo one of its most dramatic transformations.
Like most major cities, Pittsburgh experienced several days of rioting following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968. There were no further major riots, although tension remained high in the inner-city black neighborhoods.","Pittsburgh underwent significant urban renewal projects in the 1940s and 1950s, transforming the city and displacing many residents, particularly in the Hill District and East Liberty neighborhoods."
"Free market pressures exposed the U.S. steel industry's own internal problems, which included a now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility of United Steelworkers regarding wage cuts and work-rule reforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management. In particular, Pittsburgh faced its own challenges. Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted, raising material costs. The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer, more profitable ""mini-mills"" and non-union mills with lower labor costs.
Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the steel industry in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.
In 1991 the Homestead Works was demolished, replaced in 1999 by The Waterfront shopping mall. As a direct result of the loss of mill employment, the number of people living in Homestead dwindled. By the time of the 2000 census, the borough population was 3,569. The borough began financially recovering in 2002, with the enlarging retail tax base.","The collapse of the steel industry in Pittsburgh led to economic decline, population loss, and urban decay."
"Top corporate headquarters such as Gulf Oil (1985), Koppers (1987), Westinghouse (1996) and Rockwell International (1989) were bought out by larger firms, with the loss of high paying, white collar headquarters and research personnel (the ""brain drain"") as well as massive charitable contributions by the ""home based"" companies to local cultural and educational institutions.  At the time of the Gulf Oil merger in 1985 it was the largest buyout in world history involving the company that was No. 7 on the Fortune 500 just six years earlier.  Over 1,000 high paying white collar corporate and PhD research jobs were lost in one day.
Today, there are no steel mills within the city limits of Pittsburgh, although manufacture continues at regional mills, such as the Edgar Thomson Works in nearby Braddock.",Steel industry decline in Pittsburgh due to corporate takeovers and loss of skilled workers.
"Pittsburgh is home to three universities that are included in most under-graduate and graduate school national rankings, The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University.  Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh had evolved in the mid-20th century along lines that followed the needs of the heavy industries that financed and directed their development. The collapse of steel put pressure on those two universities to reinvent themselves as research centers in science and technology which acted to pull the regional economy toward high-technology fields.  Other regional collegiate institutions include Robert Morris University, Chatham University, Carlow University,  Point Park University, La Roche College, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, Trinity School for Ministry (an Episcopal seminary) and the Community College of Allegheny County.
Beginning in the 1980s, Pittsburgh's economy shifted from heavy industry to services, medicine, higher education, tourism, banking, corporate headquarters, and high technology. Today, the top two private employers in the city are the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (26,000 employees) and the West Penn Allegheny Health System (13,000 employees).","Pittsburgh has evolved from a center of heavy industry to a hub of higher education, healthcare, and technology."
"Despite the economic turmoil, civic improvements continued.  In the mid-1970s, Arthur P. Ziegler, Jr. and the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation (Landmarks) wanted to demonstrate that historic preservation could be used to drive economic development without the use of eminent domain or public subsidies.  Landmarks acquired the former terminal buildings and yards of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, a 1-mile (1.6 km) long property at the base of Mt. Washington facing the City of Pittsburgh.  In 1976, Landmarks developed the site as a mixed-use historic adaptive reuse development that gave the foundation the opportunity to put its urban planning principles into practice.  Aided by an initial generous gift from the Allegheny Foundation in 1976, Landmarks adapted five historic Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad buildings for new uses and added a hotel, a dock for the Gateway Clipper fleet, and parking areas. Now shops, offices, restaurants, and entertainment anchor the historic riverfront site on the south shore of the Monongahela River, opposite the Golden Triangle (Pittsburgh). Station Square is Pittsburgh's premier attraction, generating over 3,500,000 visitors a year. It reflects a $100 million investment from all sources, with the lowest public cost and highest taxpayer return of any major renewal project in the Pittsburgh region since the 1950s. In 1994, Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation sold Station Square in to Forest City Enterprises which created an endowment to help support its restoration efforts and educational programs. Each year the staff and docents of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation introduce more than 10,000 people – teachers, students, adults, and visitors – to the architectural heritage of the Pittsburgh region and to the value of historic preservation.
During this period, Pittsburgh also became a national model for community development, through the work of activists such as Dorothy Mae Richardson, who founded Neighborhood Housing Services in 1968, an organization that became the model for the nationwide NeighborWorks America. Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop.
In 1985, the J & L Steel site on the north side of the Monongahela river was cleared and a publicly subsidized High Technology Center was built. The Pittsburgh Technology Center, home to many major technology companies, is planning major expansion in the area soon. In the 1980s, the ""Renaissance II"" urban revitalization created numerous new structures, such as PPG Place. In the 1990s, the former sites of the Homestead, Duquesne and South Side J&L mills were cleared. In 1992, the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport opened. In 2001, the aging Three Rivers Stadium was replaced by Heinz Field and PNC Park, despite being rejected by voter referendum. In 2010, PPG Paints Arena, replaced the Civic Arena, which at the time was the oldest arena in the National Hockey League.
Also in 1985, Al Michaels revealed to a national TV audience how Pittsburgh had transformed itself from an industrial rust belt city.","Despite economic turmoil, historic preservation efforts in Pittsburgh led to significant civic improvements, including the development of Station Square, a mixed-use historic adaptive reuse development that generated over 3,500,000 visitors annually and received a $100 million investment."
"Present-day Pittsburgh, with a diversified economy, a low cost of living, and a rich infrastructure for medicine and  education and culture, has been ranked as one of the World's Most Livable Cities. Tourism has recently boomed in Pittsburgh with nearly 3,000 new hotel rooms opening since 2004 and holding a consistently higher occupancy than in comparable cities.  Medicine has replaced steel as a leading industry. Meanwhile, tech giants such as Apple, Google, IBM Watson, Facebook, and Intel have joined the 1,600 technology firms choosing to operate out of Pittsburgh.  As a result of the proximity to CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC), there has a boom of autonomous vehicles companies.  The region has also become a leader in green environmental design, a movement exemplified by the city's convention center.  In the last twenty years the region has seen a small but influential group of Asian immigrants, including from the Indian sub-continent. It has been generally considered as the most recovered city from the rust belt.","Pittsburgh, a diverse city with a strong economy, thriving tourism industry, and a focus on technology and healthcare, has experienced significant growth and development over the past two decades."

"In the early 2000s, it was announced the museum would be expanding from the old Beaux Arts-style post office into the neighboring vacant Art Deco Buhl Planetarium.  A plan was devised by Koning Eizenberg Architecture, Inc. to connect the two historic structures with a modern glass addition over what was a street called Allegheny Square.  The street was vacated and realigned and the addition was built.
The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh became the largest Silver LEED certified museum in the country in March 2006. This validates that the museum's expansion has been designed and constructed using sustainable practices with particular attention to site development, water conservation, energy management, using recycled materials, waste management, reusing resources, indoor air quality as well as developing new programs for visitors. To offer teaching moments about the new green museum, many of the building's structural and mechanical systems are left exposed.","The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh expanded its space in the 2000s by adding a modern glass addition to connect two historic structures, becoming the largest Silver LEED certified museum in the country."

"Today's museum began as an eleven-room, Italianate-style house purchased by the Fricks shortly after their marriage in 1881.  The house was built in the 1860s, original architect unknown.  After modifications by Pittsburgh architect Andrew Peebles, it was renamed ""Clayton"".  Further remodeling of the house was done in 1892 by Pittsburgh architect Frederick J. Osterling.  The Playhouse was constructed in 1897 to designs by architects Alden & Harlow. The house served as the Fricks' primary residence from 1883 to 1905.  The Fricks moved to New York City in 1905, where they eventually established the Frick Collection, but in 1981 daughter Helen Clay Frick returned to Clayton, where she had previously spent part of each year, and remained there permanently until her death in 1984. Clayton opened to the public in 1990, and in 1997 the 1950s carriage house was enlarged to create the Car and Carriage Museum.
In May 2013 the center announced a $15 million renovation to break ground on June 6, 2013. The renovation was completed in 2015; the Car and Carriage Museum was expanded to twice its original size, and a community center and education center were built.","The Frick mansion in Pittsburgh underwent several renovations and expansions over the years, including a $15 million renovation completed in 2015 that doubled the size of the Car and Carriage Museum and added a community center and education center."
"The Frick Art Museum's collection includes a large group of works on paper by Jean-François Millet, Renaissance and Baroque bronzes, and nineteenth-century European paintings. There are also Late Medieval and Renaissance paintings of a devotional nature by: Bernardo Daddi, Lippo Memmi, Giovanni di Paolo, Francesco di Vannuccio (""Saint Catherine""), Rainaldo di Rainuccio da Spoleto, Sassetta, Matteo Di Giovanni, Francesco Melzi, and Jean Bellegambe. In the Frick Art Museum, there are Renaissance and Baroque paintings with secular themes by: Apollonio Di Giovanni (""Scenes from Homer's Odyssey""), Jean-Louis de Marne (""Seine at Saint Cloud""), Carle Van Loo, Maurice Quentin de la Tour, Peter Paul Rubens, Jan Steen, Jan van Os, and Arthur Devis. In Clayton, in the mansion Frick lived in are 19th Century paintings by Jules Cazin, Jean-François Raffaëlli, and Anton Mauve.
Automobiles on display include an 1881 Brougham, 1898 Panhard et Levassor Tonneau, 1903 Baker Electric, 1906 Outing Wagon, 1909 Bailey Electric Phaeton, 1909 Keystone Sixty-Six Roadster, 1911 Penn 30 Touring Car, 1912 Daimler Landaulet, 1914 Ford Model T Touring Car, 1914 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost Touring Car, 1917 Standard  Model E Touring Car, 1924 Auto Red Bug Flyer, 1931 Lincoln Model K Sport Phaeton, and 1940 American Bantam Convertible Coupe.

"The PCA's opened on March 17, 1945, as the ""Arts and Craft Center"" at Fifth and Shady Avenues. Almost 1000 Pittsburghers gathered at the opening night ceremonies, headed by Mayor Cornelius D. Scully, J. Bailey Ellis, who was named chairman of the Center, and Mrs. Charles D. Marshall, who publicly turned the key to her home over to the city.
Ten artist groups comprised the center at its founding: 

Pittsburgh Drama League (founded 1913)
Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen (founded 1944)
Weavers Guild of Pittsburgh (founded 1940)
Society of Sculptors (founded 1934)
Pittsburgh Civic Ballet (founded 1941)
Abstract Artists Group of Pittsburgh
Musician's Club of Pittsburgh (founded 1913)
Associated Artists of Pittsburgh (founded 1910)
Contemporary Dance Group
Authors’ Club (founded 1918).
The first program after the grand opening was a musicale given by the Musician's Club on March 25, 1945. Each of the ten groups was responsible for holding five programs open to the public each year. The first Christmas Bazaar was held in November 1946, and continues today as the Holiday Sale.
The organization was chartered in July 1947. The first annual meeting to which all members of the various artist groups were invited was held on January 12, 1948. The newly revised by-laws were read and accepted. The elected board and officers were unpaid.
The center's dedication to improving the overall quality of life in Pittsburgh through education has been an essential part of its philosophy from the beginning. The first mention of classes appeared in the minutes of the June 1947 board meeting. University of Pittsburgh professor Walter Hovey, then president of the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen, asked for the use of the kitchen in order to hold a jewelry class for some 40 students.
In addition to education, the center has always sought to promote regional art. In 1948, the first Everyman's Art Show was held, open to the region's amateurs. The first Artist of the Year show was held in January 1949, honoring painter Balcombe Greene. In the April 1954, the Center went on the air on WQED-TV with the weekly, half-hour series You, the Artists hosted by sculptor Everett Sturgeon. From 1981 to 1989, the center renewed its relationship with WQED with the weekly Lyceum (later Studio 13,) hosted by Mary Rawson. Ongoing attempts were made in print as well, starting from the earliest days with a mimeographed newsletter, Musings, from 1975-79 with Quidnunc, and later in expanded course catalogs and the quarterly Art Lines.","The Arts and Craft Center, founded in 1945, was a hub for Pittsburgh artists, hosting educational programs, exhibitions, and cultural events, promoting regional art, and expanding its reach through media and television."
"Eventually, volunteers could not keep abreast of an increasingly complex artistic and organizational environment. By the late 1960s, the center's administration resembled “an octopus without a head,” according to the Pittsburgh Press's Patricia Lowry. Artist Danny Butts was engaged as the center's first full-time director. He was succeeded by businessman Jerrold Rouby in 1970. Additional paid positions were added then: an education director and sales director. The Center's classes and enrollment expanded during Rouby's tenure.
In 1975, Audrey Bethel became the center's director. Under her leadership, the groundwork was laid for many changes. Nationally known artists visited the center, the board of directors was restructured, and the center's name was changed. Cheryl Towers became director in 1981, and later hired ceramicist Sande Deitch as full-time exhibitions director. Deitch became director of the Center in 1987; Murray Horne became exhibitions director.",The document describes the evolution of the Carnegie Institute of Music Hall from its early days as an octopus-like organization to a more structured and nationally recognized institution under the leadership of various directors.
"For the center, the late 1990s were marked with ambitious programs, but also financial difficulty. In February 2002, five staff—including Executive Director Laura Willumsen and Curator Vicky Clark—were laid off and the exhibitions department eliminated. In August 2004, 13 staff members were laid off. The center was approximately $1 million in debt, and its doors were closed.
The center has offered special prizes of Artist of the Year and Emerging Artist of the Year, along with its Biennial exhibitions of local contemporary artists. Previous winners of prizes include Delanie Jenkins, Clayton Merrill, and George Anastasios Magalios.
In September 2004, Charlie Humphrey became the unpaid interim director of PCA. The center reopened, after having been closed only for a few weeks. In relatively short order, missed payments to artists were rectified and relationships with foundations were repaired.
In January 2006, following votes by the Pittsburgh Filmmakers membership, Pittsburgh Center for the Arts board and Pittsburgh Filmmakers board, the merger of the two organizations became final. The Pittsburgh Filmmakers by-laws were carried over as the by-laws of the merged organization.
In Fall 2010, the combined Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts entered into merger discussions with the Pittsburgh Glass Center.  By May 2011, the talks had failed, with the Pittsburgh Glass Center withdrawing from negotiations.","The Pittsburgh Center for the Arts (PCA) experienced financial difficulties in the late 1990s, leading to staff layoffs and the closure of the center. However, it was eventually revived with the merger of PCA and Pittsburgh Filmmakers in 2006."
"Throughout the years many renovations were made at both the Marshall building, which houses the galleries, and the Scaife building, which houses the school. The last major renovation was to the Marshall building, which reopened March 24, 1990 with a dedication by Mayor Sophie Masloff to 800 guests, including Jane Marshall Fisher, granddaughter of the building's original donor.
The center has a campus arrangement of four buildings, three of which (two mansions and a carriage house) are rented from the city for $1.00 per year. The fourth structure houses newly built kilns.","The document discusses the renovations and current state of the Marshall building and Scaife building, including their use as a gallery and school, and the rental arrangement of the buildings."
"For the industrialists in the early 1900s, a major living area was Pittsburgh's East End, where a building boom was underway. A parade of mansions were commissioned along Fifth Avenue to what became known as “Millionaires Row” for some of the wealthiest and most celebrated families in Pittsburgh, such as the Mellons, the Benedums, and the Fricks.
In 1909, one of the most impressive mansions built was the 65-room Richard Beatty Mellon House on the 11 acres (4.5 ha) of land bordering Fifth Avenue, Shady Avenue and Beechwood Boulevard on what is now known as Mellon Park. Richard Beatty Mellon and his wife Jennie King Mellon raised two children, Sarah Cordelia King Mellon and Richard King Mellon. Jennie King Mellon had a love for flowers and had two very large flower gardens facing Beechwood Boulevard, which still exists in Mellon Park today. Next to the mansion was a garage and carriage house, which housed servants on the second floor. This carriage house was donated to the City and is now the Phipps Garden Center. The 65-room mansion was torn down in 1941.
In 1904, there was another earlier Tudor revival mansion built on the Mellon Estate. It was given as a wedding gift in 1927 to Richard Beatty's daughter Sarah, who married Alan Magee Scaife, fifth generation industrialist and the Director of Mellon National Bank. In February 1946, the Scaifes also donated their home and property to the City. This mansion is now the Scaife Building that houses the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts School.
Next door to the Mellon Estate, on the corner of Fifth and Shady Avenues, Charles D. Marshall, president and co-owner of the McClintic-Marshall Construction Company, which later became Bethlehem Steel, built his mansion. Completed in 1912, the Marshall mansion was an impressive formal 17th-Century Carolean-inspired building. In 1943, Charles Marshall also donated his house at 6300 Fifth Avenue to the city. The city was responsible for only the exterior maintenance. The Marshall mansion became the Arts and Crafts Center of Pittsburgh in 1945. In 1980, the name was again changed to what is now known as the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts.","The document describes the construction and donation of several mansions in Pittsburgh's East End during the early 1900s, including the Richard Beatty Mellon House, the Scaife Building, and the Marshall Mansion."
"Pittsburgh Opera was established in 1939 as the Pittsburgh Opera Company and is the eighth-oldest opera company in the United States. The company was founded by five women who established the Pittsburgh Opera Society in 1939, making possible the inaugural performance of Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann at the Carnegie Music Hall in March 1940.  The first director of the company was Richard Karp, from 1942 to 1977.  His daughter Barbara Karp took over her father's duties during his final illness.  James DeBlasis then served as interim artistic director after the resignation of Barbara Karp.  In 1983, Tito Capobianco became Pittsburgh Opera's general director, holding this position until 1997.  From 1997 to 2000, Capobianco was the company's artistic director, before leaving in 2000.
Mark Weinstein became general director of Pittsburgh Opera in 1999, after starting as executive director in 1997.  During his tenure, he presided over an increase in the company's endowment from US $4 million to US $16 million, as well as the retirement of US $2.5 million in debt.  Weinstein also presided over the addition of an extra production during the company season, 5 productions as opposed to 4, from the 2001-2002 season to the 2003-2004 season.    Weinstein announced his resignation as Pittsburgh Opera's general director effective February 1, 2008.  Artistic Director Christopher Hahn was appointed as General Director in June 2008.
During Christopher Hahn’s tenure as General Director, the company’s repertoire expanded considerably to include Baroque and many contemporary works. In 2017 Pittsburgh Opera produced its first world premiere, The Summer King – the Josh Gibson Story. Based on the life and tragic death of the Hall of Fame baseball player who grew up in Pittsburgh and starred for the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords, The Summer King featured bass-baritone Alfred Walker in the role of Josh Gibson and acclaimed mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves as his love-interest Grace.
Mr. Hahn has expanded Pittsburgh Opera’s prestigious Resident Artist Program to include two annual productions, both of which are offered as part of the full subscription series. Hailed as one of the country's leading training programs for young singers, Pittsburgh Opera’s Resident Artist Program provides professional development during a two-year session. The program has fostered the careers of singers that regularly perform on the world stage, including Marianne Cornetti, Rolando Villazón, Oren Gradus, David Miller, Maria Zifchak, Kevin Glavin, Danielle Pastin, Sean Panikkar, and Audrey Luna. In 2017, Luna sang the highest note ever recorded in the Metropolitan Opera’s 130-year history.
Mr. Hahn also led the 2008 move to Pittsburgh Opera’s new headquarters Archived 2021-06-14 at the Wayback Machine in the historic George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory at 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburgh’s Strip District, and developed a range of audience and community programs that take place there. The building has a deep connection to Pittsburgh’s storied past – it was built as George Westinghouse’s original air brake factory in 1869. At 45,000 square feet, the renovated building features offices, 4,000 square feet of rehearsal spaces, costume, wig, and makeup shops, and a kitchen, meeting the “multimedia” requirements of opera. The renovation resulted in Silver-level LEED certification in the Operations and Maintenance category in June 2011, and incorporates the site’s exposed brick interiors, 150 historically-accurate windows and original metal fire safes.
Christopher Hahn served as the company's artistic director from 2000 until his appointment as General Director. John Mauceri was Music Director of Pittsburgh Opera from 2000 until his resignation in 2006, to take up an academic post in North Carolina.  In October 2006, Antony Walker was named the next Music Director of Pittsburgh Opera, and assumed the post immediately.  Walker's initial contract was for 3 years, but has since been extended through the 2011-12 season.
On April 1, 2008, in a performance of Verdi's Aïda at the Benedum Center, in the final act of the opera, Walker stepped in to sing the role of Radames from the orchestra pit, conducting at the same time, while the tenor acted the role on stage.","Pittsburgh Opera, founded in 1939, has been led by several notable directors and artistic directors, including Richard Karp, James DeBlasis, Tito Capobianco, Mark Weinstein, and Christopher Hahn, who has been the General Director since 1999. The company has expanded its repertoire, added a Resident Artist Program, and renovated its headquarters."

"Randy Gilson was born in Homestead, Pennsylvania. Early in life he suffered from homelessness and poverty. He moved to Pittsburgh's Northside in 1982, where he was a community activist, planting over 800 street gardens and 50 vegetable gardens.  His guerrilla gardening planted vacant lots in Manchester, the Mexican War Streets, and surrounding neighborhoods.
He bought the property that would become Randyland on a credit card for $10,000 in 1995. Using upcycling, Gilson decorates his home with items such as mannequins, plastic dinosaurs and pink flamingos. The fences display murals with neighbors dancing and smiling.
In late 2016, Gilson's partner David Paul Francis ""Mac"" McDermott was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. Upon hearing the news, Randyland fans raised over $20,000 and sent Gilson and McDermott on their first vacation. The couple visited the Grand Canyon and Hollywood. Afterwards, Gilson retired from his restaurant job to spend more time with the ailing McDermott. Following the announcement, Foo Conner joined Randyland as co-director.
The neighborhood around the museum experienced explosive growth in 2016-2019. Randyland itself reportedly doubled in attendance. The courtyard was overhauled to accommodate the traffic. Under Conner's curation, the facility embraced being a selfie museum as a vibrant backdrop for photos.
McDermott died on January 10, 2019. As Gilson's partner, he was posthumously given the title of co-founder. Journalists noted that McDermott may have downplayed his role when alive but was a backbone of the museum. Later that year, Randyland received the Mayor's Award for Public Art for 2019. Conner left the museum early 2020.
Because it is outdoors, Randyland was one of the only art museums open in Pennsylvania during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gilson came out of retirement. The Courtyard was changed to a socially distanced playground throughout quarantine. Many of the original murals have been painted over.

"Andrew Carnegie first thought of setting up a museum in 1886 that would preserve a ""record of the progress and development of pictorial art in America."" Dedicated on November 5, 1895, the art gallery was initially housed in the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh's Main Branch in Oakland.
Carnegie initially envisioned a museum collection consisting of the ""Old Masters of tomorrow"". The museum received a major expansion in 1907 with the addition of the Hall of Architecture, Hall of Sculpture, and Bruce Galleries, with funds again provided by Carnegie.
Under the directorship of Leon A. Arkus, the Sarah Mellon Scaife Gallery (125,000 square feet) was built as an addition to the existing Carnegie Institute. Designed by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes, it first opened in 1974 and more than doubled the museum's exhibition space, also adding a children's studio, theater, café, offices, and bookstore. The New York Times art critic John Russell described the gallery as an ""unflawed paradise."" The gallery has been renovated several times since its original creation, most recently in 2004.
Today the museum also stages the Carnegie International every few years. Numerous significant works from the Internationals have been acquired for museum's permanent collection including Winslow Homer's The Wreck (1896) and James A. McNeill Whistler's Arrangement in Black: Portrait of Señor Pablo de Sarasate (1884).","The Carnegie Museum of Art, founded by Andrew Carnegie in 1895, has undergone numerous expansions and renovations, including the addition of the Sarah Mellon Scaife Gallery in 1974, which doubled its exhibition space and added a children's studio, theater, café, offices, and bookstore."
"The museum's curatorial departments include: Fine Arts (Contemporary Art, Works on Paper), Decorative Arts, Architecture and Photography. Every year, the museum hosts up to 15 different exhibitions. Approximately 35,000 pieces make up its permanent collection, which also includes works on paper, paintings, prints (particularly Japanese prints), sculptures, and installations from the late seventeenth century to the present. The museum has notably strong collections of both aluminum relics and chairs. Approximately 1,800 works are on view at any given time.
The museum also maintains a large archive of negatives from African American photographer Charles ""Teenie"" Harris.
Heinz Architectural Center - The collection includes works in architecture, landscape design, engineering, and furniture and interior design. The center's facilities includes 4,000 square feet of exhibition space and a library housing several thousand books and journals.
The Hillman Photography Initiative - The Initiative hosts a variety of projects including live public events, web-based projects, documentary videos, art projects, and writing. Yearly programming is determine by a group of five ""agents"" who plan and curate each 12-month cycle of works hosted.

"Ailsa Mellon Bruce Galleries (1907) – The Ailsa Mellon Bruce Galleries were originally constructed to display reproduction bronze casts from Pompeii and Herculaneum. The gallery was renovated in 2009, and currently exhibits more than 500 objects representing American and European decorative arts from the Rococo and Neoclassical periods of the 18th century to contemporary design and craft.
Hall of Architecture (1907) – The Hall of Architecture houses almost 140 full-size plaster casts of elements of buildings found in the ancient and classical civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome, and from Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance Europe. It is the largest collection of plaster casts of architectural masterpieces in America and one of the three largest in the world, along with those of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Musée national des Monuments Français in Paris.
Hall of Sculpture (1907) – The Hall of Sculpture was modeled after the Parthenon's inner sanctuary and was originally created to house the museum's 69 plaster casts of Egyptian, Near Eastern, Greek, and Roman sculpture. Today it exhibits works from the permanent collections, with its balcony displaying decorative arts objects from the eighteenth to the twentieth century.
Heinz Architectural Center (1993) – dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings and models.
Scaife Galleries (1974) – The Scaife Galleries display the permanent collection of the museum, and contains paintings, sculptures, works on paper, film, and video pieces.
Forum Gallery – Located on the first floor of the museum just inside the Forbes Avenue entrance, this single room is dedicated to temporary exhibitions of contemporary art. It opened November 3, 1990, with support from the National Endowment of the Arts – The first exhibition, Forum 1, was a solo show of Jeff Wall. Subsequent exhibitions were numbered sequentially (for example, Forum 40 featured Felix de la Concha). Unlike larger museum exhibitions, which can take up to three years to plan and execute, Forum shows come together relatively quickly, and are open to any curatorial staff's vision. In the words of Vicky Clark, a longtime curator at the museum, ""The idea was to make sure that we had an exhibition of contemporary art set up at all times.""","The Ailsa Mellon Bruce Galleries, Hall of Architecture, Hall of Sculpture, Heinz Architectural Center, Scaife Galleries, and Forum Gallery are various galleries and collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art."

"The Nationality Room Program was founded by Ruth Crawford Mitchell at the request of Pitt Chancellor John Bowman in 1926, in order to involve the community in constructing the Cathedral of Learning and to provide the spiritual and symbolic foundation of the Cathedral that would make the inside of the building as inspiring and impressive as the outside. Under Mitchell's direction, invitations were extended to national communities in the Pittsburgh area to sponsor a room that was representative of their heritage. Each group formed a Room Committee responsible for fundraising, designing, and acquisition. The university provided the room and upkeep in perpetuity once completed, while all other materials, labor, and design were provided by the individual committees. These were sometimes partly provided for by foreign governments which, ""...responded with generous support, often providing architects, artists, materials, and monetary gifts to assure authenticity and superb quality in their classrooms.""  Each room is carefully designed and executed down to the switch plates, door handles, hinges, and wastebaskets. The work is often performed and designed by native artists and craftsmen and involves imported artifacts and materials.  Mitchell remained Director of the Nationality Rooms program until 1956, having overseen the creation of the first 19 rooms on the first floor of the cathedral.  A successor to Mitchell wasn't named until 1965 when E. Maxine Bruhns took over the program, overseeing the completion of twelve additional rooms on the third floor. Bruhns retired on Jan. 1, 2020, after 54 years in the position, and died in July 2020.

A typical room on the 1st floor built between 1938 and 1957 took between three and ten years to complete, and would have cost the equivalent of $453,417 today, which was no small undertaking, especially considering that the fundraising and construction of the initial rooms took place during the Great Depression and World War II.  More recent rooms have cost in the range of US$750,000 and up, and took up to ten years to complete.  Upon completion of their rooms, the committees turn to a program of intercultural exchange and fundraising for nationality rooms scholarships which enable University of Pittsburgh students and faculty to study abroad.  The room committees also sponsor cultural and fundraising events, lectures, concerts, exhibits, social events, and workshops on ethnic studies that may utilize the rooms.  The committee may use its room for non-political meetings, lectures, or other functions if no classes are scheduled. Distinguished international visitors are received by the committees, and special projects are undertaken including the purchase of books for the University libraries, publication of volumes on topics from comparative literature to ethnic recipes, and the fostering of courses in the mother languages.  National, traditional, and religious holidays are celebrated on campus, and committees decorate their rooms or mount displays to commemorate special occasions.
The first four rooms to be dedicated were the Scottish, Russian, German, and Swedish Rooms in 1938."" The newest rooms are the Turkish and Swiss rooms, both dedicated in 2012, the Korean room dedicated in 2015, and the Philippine Room dedicated in 2019.
Original plans also proposed, in addition to the Nationality Rooms on the first floor, the creation of ""Pennsylvania"" classrooms on the second floor to be dedicated to the pioneering groups within the state along with third floor ""Pittsburgh"" classrooms dedicated to showcasing the history of the Western Pennsylvania or different eras of American history.  Although the plans for the series of rooms were drawn up, only one room was installed, the Early American Classroom, which is now counted among the other Nationality Rooms. The plans for the other Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania rooms were never executed, and the Nationality Room program grew to occupy all of the first and much of the third floor.

Upon completion of a room, a dedication ceremony is held with a formal presentation of a ceremonial key to the university's Chancellor to symbolize the bestowal and acceptance of the gift, and a commitment by the university to maintain the room in perpetuity. The nationality room committee officers then become members of the Nationality Council which provides scholarships for summer study abroad for Pitt students, along with other non-political cultural or educational events within the Nationality Program's scope. Today, the cathedral is home to 31 Nationality Rooms (29 working classrooms and two display rooms: the Early American Room and the Syrian-Lebanon Room), on the first and third floors. Each nationality room celebrates a different culture that influenced Pittsburgh's growth, depicting an era prior to 1787, the university's founding and the signing of the United States Constitution. Only one room does not follow this convention, with the French Classroom depicting the First French Empire of the early 19th century. There are two additional rooms in the process of being approved and funded.
Set in the Cathedral of Learning's cornerstone in 1937 is a gift from the Nationality Room Committee chairpersons to the university: a copper plate engraved with these thoughts:

Faith and peace are in their hearts. Good will has brought them together. Like the Magi of ancestral traditions and the shepherds of candid simplicity, they offer their gifts of what is precious, genuine and their own, to truth that shines forever and enlightens all people.
Since 1944, tours of the nationality rooms have been given to visitors by a Pitt student organization, Quo Vadis (Latin: Where do you go?), that guides over 40,000 tourists a year. With reservations, specially themed tours based on creature symbolism, images of royalty, and folktales are also given. An estimated 100,000 visitors, including self-guided and walk-in tourists, visit the Nationality Rooms each year.","The Nationality Room Program at the University of Pittsburgh was established in 1926 to create classrooms that reflect the cultural heritage of Pittsburgh's communities, with each room designed and maintained by local artists and craftsmen. The program has grown to include 31 Nationality Rooms on the first and third floors of the Cathedral of Learning, celebrating cultures from around the world."
"The following principles, in order to assure commonality of purpose, authenticity, and non-political cultural emphasis, governed the creation of nationality rooms from the programs inception in 1926 until the completion of the Irish Classroom in 1957.

A Nationality Room must illustrate one of the outstanding architectural or design traditions of a nation that is recognized as such by the United States Department of State.
The design of a given historical period must be cultural and aesthetic, not political.  The period depicted should be prior to 1787, the year the university was founded.
To avoid political implications in the room, no political symbol is permitted in the decorations, nor a portrait or likeness of any living person.
The only place a political symbol may be used is in the corridor stone above the room's entrance.
No donor recognition may appear in the rooms. Donor recognition to the rooms is recorded in a Donor Book.
Most architects and designers of the rooms have been born and educated abroad.  This has been instrumental in ensuring authenticity of design.
In the 1970s, policy revisions were implemented which retaining most of the earlier principles, utilized a broader definition of nation to include a body of people associated with a particular territory and possessing a distinctive cultural and social way of life.  This allowed the creation of the Armenian and Ukrainian rooms prior to their establishment as independent nations following the collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as allowing for the installation of the African Heritage Room.
The room must also be a functional teaching classroom with enough student tablet-armed seats, professor's lectern or table, adequate sight lines and lighting, modern audiovisual technology, and other necessities of a classroom.  New rooms also have narrated tour equipment. Materials are to remain authentic and durable that are executed through architectural form and not mere surface embellishment and are to provide eternal qualities that have the potential to ""teach"" about the cultures with appropriate non-political symbols and artifacts.","The document outlines the principles governing the creation of nationality rooms at the University of Notre Dame, emphasizing authenticity, non-political themes, and cultural significance while ensuring they function as functional teaching classrooms."
"The African Heritage Classroom was designed to reflect an 18th-century Asante temple courtyard in Ghana which would provide the setting for ceremonial events, learning, and worship.  The classroom represents the entire continent of Africa with Yoruba-style door carvings by Nigerian sculptor Lamidi O. Fakeye depicting ancient kingdoms of Africa including Egypt, Nubia, Ethiopia, Benin, Kongo/Angola, Kuba, Mali, and Zimbabwe. Plaster forms in the frieze represent the arts, music, science, languages, and literature of Africa. A display case housing artifacts from various African nations and the chalkboard area reflect patos around the courtyard. Below the chalkboard doors depicting the Igbo lozenge and star motif are Sankofa birds which symbolize the need to learn from the past in order to prepare for the future.  The oxblood steps, two levels of student benches, and wainscot with relief decorations suggest the polished clay of an Asante temple.  Openwork screens are present on the windows as they are used in Asante structures to filter the sun's rays while allowing air flow.  Six chieftain stools provide informal seating near a hand-carved professor's lectern.","The African Heritage Classroom is a replica of an 18th-century Asante temple courtyard in Ghana, featuring Yoruba-style door carvings, plaster forms, artifacts, and openwork screens reflecting African arts, music, and literature."
"The Armenian Classroom was inspired by the 10th- to 12th-century Sanahin Monastery. The design consists of intersecting arches and a domed ceiling built to lessen damage from frequent earthquakes in that country. The room's arches, built of Indiana limestone, make this the heaviest of the Nationality Rooms, weighing 22 tons, and required the second floor beneath the room to be reinforced in order to support its weight. The cornerstone is a basalt stone from the grounds of Sanahin. In the mortar behind it are the thumbprints of five of the oldest Armenian diaspora living in the Pittsburgh area, as well as the handprint of an infant of Armenian descent, symbolizing the continuity of the Armenian presence in western Pennsylvania.","The Armenian Classroom is a unique architectural design inspired by the Sanahin Monastery, featuring intersecting arches and a domed ceiling, and includes a cornerstone with thumbprints and handprints representing the Armenian diaspora in Pittsburgh."
"The Austrian Nationality Room represents the 18th-century era of the Austrian Empire during its age of enlightenment under Empress Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II and incorporates Baroque elements of the Haydnsaal in Schloss Esterházy at Eisenstadt where Joseph Haydn served as Kapellmeister from 1766 to 1778.  Ceiling paintings depict scenes from Roman mythology similar to those in the Haydnsaal.  The room features Lobmeyer crystal chandeliers, gilded white lacquer seminar furniture patterned after that in the formal dining hall of Vienna's Hofburg, royal red-tapestried walls, gold-leafed pilasters, and a parquet floor inlaid in a starburst design. Exhibits in the display cases in the room trace the development of the multinational Austrian Empire and the birthplaces of representative Austrian composers born within its borders between the years 1000 and 1918.","The Austrian Nationality Room is a historical exhibit featuring Baroque elements and ceiling paintings depicting Roman mythology, showcasing the Austrian Empire's enlightenment period and the birthplaces of Austrian composers."
"The Chinese Classroom is inspired by the design of a palace hall in Beijing's Forbidden City and is dedicated to the memory of Confucius and his democratic ideal of classless education. The teacher and students sit at the same level around a moon-shaped teakwood table.  The professor's chair is carved with the admonition to ""Teach by inspiring gradually and steadily"". A slate portrait of Confucius is present that is patterned after one in the Confucian temple at his birthplace of Qufu in Shandong Province.  Above the red lacquered door, Chinese characters are carved into the stone lintel that proclaim that ""Humility of mind goes with loftiness of character."" Stone lions flank the entrance before carvings of the plum blossom, the national flower of China. The ceiling contains a coiling golden five-clawed imperial dragon surrounded by clouds denoting nature's energy and freedom.  Painted squares portray dragons guarding the pearl of wisdom and the phoenix with the motan flower, a symbol of cultural wealth.  The opened blackboard doors reveal painted renditions of the babao, or Eight Treasures, popular in Chinese art.  On the base below is a carved version of the Bagua which consists of eight trigrams surrounding the circular Yin and Yang.  Windows consist of frosted glass with stylized cames.","A Chinese classroom inspired by the Forbidden City features a moon-shaped teakwood table, Confucius' portrait, and elements like dragons and phoenixes, reflecting Confucius' democratic ideals of classless education."
"The Czechoslovak Classroom combines elements of a Slovak farmhouse, country church, and the Charles University in Prague while detailing men who contributed to Czechoslovak culture. The motto of the classroom, and of the former Czechoslovak government in exile, is proclaimed by the inscription of ""Pravda Vítězí"" which translates to ""Truth Will Prevail"" and surrounds a bronze relief portrait of the first President and founder of Czechoslovakia Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk.  In a wrought-iron case near the window bay, a letter penned by the hand of Masaryk to students at the University of Pittsburgh recalls John Amos Comenius' belief that ""education is the workshop of humanity"".  All woodwork, except the furniture, is made of larch wood which grows to great heights in the Carpathian Mountains. The ceiling, with flat boards overlapping each other between heavy beams, is painted by Prague artists Karel Svolinský and Marie Svolinská and depicts botanically accurate flowers and plants of Czechoslovakia and reflects a typical Slovak farmer's home and the style of country churches.  A ""tree of life"" design on the rear wall surrounds the text of the proclamation by King of Bohemia and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire Charles IV that marked the founding of the University of Prague in 1348.   The plaster reveals of the bay window area is decorated by murals of miraculous trees bearing flowers and fruits and harboring animals, birds, and insects reflecting ""peasant writings"" and executed by the artists in freehand.  Ceiling panels portray eight famous persons in Czech and Slovak history from the 9th through 19th centuries including Cyril and Methodius who created the Cyrillic script, Waclaw who was the ""Good King Wenceslaus"" of the Christmas Carol, Jan Hus who was a champion of Czech religious freedom, John Amos Comenius who is considered the father of modern education, Ján Kollár a Slovak poet who called for Slavic unity, Ľudovít Štúr who developed the Slovak literary language, and Bishop Stefan Moyzes who pioneered popular education in Slovakia. Intarsia done by V. Kopka of Moravia are found on the entrance door panels and the professor's desk and lectern which depicts university academic disciplines.  Embroidery, lace, Bohemian crystal, and historical documents are displayed in the wall cabinet.","The Czechoslovak Classroom is a unique educational building combining elements of a Slovak farmhouse, country church, and Charles University in Prague, featuring portraits, murals, and historical figures."
"The Early American Room is one of two display rooms not used as a functional classroom, although it is opened for guided tours.  The room was commissioned by longtime University Pittsburgh trustee George Hubbard Clapp, a descendant nine generations removed from Roger Clapp, an English captain who sailed into the New England port of Hull on May 30, 1630. The kitchen-living room of the early colonists was chosen to portray the sturdy simplicity of life in America during the 1650s. The room's focus is a nine-foot fireplace constructed from 200-year-old handmade bricks with ""fixings"" of a log hook, heavy iron kettles, a spider, gridiron, longhandled waffle iron, bread shovel, skewers, ladles, and forks. A small recess in the brick wall served to bake bread. A tapered pole swings out from the end of the fireplace to be used for drying laundry or to hang a quilt to keep the cold draft from those gathered near the fire. Massive hand-hewn pine beams used in the seven-foot-high ceiling and the fireplace were collected after a careful search in Massachusetts. White pine is used for the heavy seminar table, benches, and chairs. Wrought-iron candelabra are hinged with clasps to hold lighting tapers. Other light fixtures are of specially designed pierced tin. The colonial-style windows were designed by glass artist Charles Connick. Decorative items include a collection of 17th- and 18th-century American coins, a working spinning wheel, and a hand-stitched sampler. The small closet between the blackboard and fireplace contains a secret panel and once the concealed latch is discovered, its release causes the wall to swing open, revealing a hidden staircase to the upper loft, which has been furnished as a 19th-century bedroom.  Included in the bedroom is a four-poster rope bed and small cradle, both of which belonged to pianist and composer Ethelbert Nevin. The bedroom also includes several personal items, including an 1878 wedding quilt, which belonged to Waitman Worthington McDaniel and his wife Martha Jane Poe, the grandmother of Nationality Director Maxine Bruhns. The room is associated with various stories of unexplained incidents that have resulted in claims that the room is haunted.","The Early American Room is a museum exhibit showcasing the living conditions of early American settlers in the 1650s, featuring a nine-foot fireplace, handmade bricks, and period furniture."
"The English Classroom is designed in the Tudor-Gothic style after the House of Commons that was rebuilt by Sir Charles Barry following the fire of 1834.  The English Classroom is the largest of the Nationality Rooms and incorporates several original items given as gifts from the British Government from the damaged House of Commons, whose Chamber was completely destroyed, following its bombing by the Luftwaffe in 1941, including the stone fireplace, hearth tiles, linenfold oak paneling, entrance doorframe, lintel, and corbels.  The fireplace is from the Commons' ""Aye Lobby"", so named because members walk through it to vote ""yes"" to a bill, and is marked with the initials V.R. for Victoria Regina. The cast-iron fireback and andirons commemorate the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 and an inscription above the fireplace is from Shakespeare's King Richard II and uses lettering adapted from the letter tiles originally designed for medieval paving by the Monks of Chertsey Abbey in Surrey. The inscription reads: ""Set in the silver sea.....this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England."" Above the doorway hangs a royal coat of arms made in 1688 during the reign of King James II. The linenfold paneling itself arrived at the university still having a blackened coat from the bombing.  Under the ceiling trusses are four carved limestone corbels from the House of Commons that are carved with a Tudor rose.  Two corbels remain uncarved to emphasize the original carved corbels. The window frames, set in limestone, are characteristic of the Tudor period, and contain old imported glass, seeded and tinted, and encased in small, diamond-shaped leaded frames. Stained-glass window medallions depict the coats of arms of English towns and cities, literary and political figures, scholars of the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford, and the Houses of Lords and Commons.  Portraits of University of Pittsburgh alumnus and former Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, Andrew Mellon, and the former Earl of Chatham, William Pitt, after whom the city was named, flank the stained glass windows in the rear bay. A brick from 10 Downing Street serves as the room's cornerstone.  The white oak floor is fitted together with wooden peg dowels. Tudor-Gothic oak benches resemble the old House of Commons benches and are similarly arranged. Two English oak tables with melon-shaped legs stand before the bay.  Two House of Commons Library chairs upholstered in green leather and bearing the official gold crest featuring the portcullis and crown were a gift of Lord Alfred Bossom and were rebuilt using wood from actual chairs in the bombed House of Commons.","The English Classroom at the University of Pittsburgh is a Tudor-Gothic-style building designed to resemble the House of Commons after its reconstruction following the 1941 bombing. It features numerous original artifacts from the destroyed House of Commons, including a stone fireplace, linenfold oak paneling, and a royal coat of arms."
"The French Classroom was designed by Jacques Carlu, Director of the School of Architecture in Fontainebleau, in the French Empire Period that reflects a French style inspired by the glories of the ancient and classical past that were rediscovered during the Napoleonic campaigns in Greece, Italy, and Egypt. This places the timeframe of inspiration for the classroom in the late 18th century and early 19th century, just after the founding of the University of Pittsburgh in 1787, therefore making it the only classroom which represents an era postdating the founding of the university, although many room elements are influenced by the Palace of Versailles which clearly predates it.  The color scheme of the room is blue-gray, royal blue, and gold, which were suggested by French-American architect Paul Philippe Cret and are typical colors used at the height of the French Empire. The walls of the room are lined with wood paneling in classical proportions, and slender wall pilasters are capped with delicately carved ad gilded crowns. Carved ornaments of the Egyptian griffin and classical rosettes accentuate panel divisions.  A wall cabinet containing art objects, books, and medallions balances the entrance door and maintains the room's symmetry.  Crystal and metal chandeliers, which are simplified versions of those found in Palace of Versailles' Hall of Mirrors, hang from a grey plaster ceiling. A parquet floor pattern also reflects many rooms in the Palace of Versailles. A mahogany professor's chair and table are of the Directoire period design include bronze ornaments imported from France that are replicas of originals of Empire furniture in the Louvre.  The mahogany student tablet armchairs are upholstered in royal blue. On the rear wall, a 16th-century Choufleur tapestry depicts an allegorical woodland scene including, among other animals, a unicorn which often served as a central figure in tapestries and legends from the Middle Ages.  Gold damask draperies with a wreath and lyre motif add to the sense of French opulence and frame the windows which look out on the university's Heinz Memorial Chapel, itself an example of French Gothic architecture inspired by the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris.","The French Classroom, designed by Jacques Carlu, reflects a French style inspired by the glories of the ancient and classical past, with elements influenced by the Palace of Versailles, located before the founding of the University of Pittsburgh."
"The German Classroom was designed by German-born architect Frank A. Linder to reflect the 16th century German Renaissance as exemplified in the Alte Aula (Great Hall) of the University of Heidelberg. The woodwork of the room was done by German-born Philadelphia decorator Gustav Ketterer and includes walnut paneling framing the blackboards, columns carved with arabesques flanking the two entrance doorways, and support broken-arch pediments surmounted by carved polychromed crests of the two oldest German universities: Heidelberg (1386) and Leipzig (1409). The doors are mounted with ornate wrought-iron hinges and locks, and their upper panels are decorated with intarsia depicting the central square of Nürnberg on the front door and the fountain of Rothenburg on the rear door. Carved in the architrave above the paneling are the names of famous philosophers, poets, musicians, artists, and scientists. The intarsia doors of the four corner cabinets feature tales from German folklore including Parsifal who searched for the Holy Grail, Siegfried who was the hero of the Nibelungenlied, the maiden wooed in Goethe's poem Heidenröslein, and Lorelei who was the golden-haired Rhine maiden whose song lured sailors to destruction. Painted on the escutcheon above the front blackboard are words from Friedrich Schiller's Das Ideal und das Leben, ""Stern endeavor, which no arduous task can shake, to the hidden fount of true attains."" The rear wall has a quotation from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Was wir bringen which reads: ""Great mastery results from wise restraint, and law alone points the way to liberty."" Furniture includes the professor's leather upholstered chair stands on a small platform behind a burled walnut table and student tablet armchairs are walnut with scroll backs. Wrought-iron chandeliers are the work of German craftsman.  The display case contains gifts of artworks and books from Germany's Ministry of Education. The stained-glass windows were designed by master stained glass artist Charles Connick, however they were not completed until 1953 by Connick protege Frances Van Arsdale Skinner. The windows depict characters in the Grimm Brothers' fairy tales such as Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Hansel and Gretel, and Cinderella.","The German Classroom is a historic educational building designed to reflect the 16th century German Renaissance style, featuring intricate woodwork, decorative elements, and artwork that includes famous philosophers, poets, musicians, artists, and scientists."
"The classical architecture of the Greek Classroom represents 5th-century BCE. Athens, the Golden Age of Pericles and includes marble columns and a coffered ceiling. Colored details from the Acropolis' Propylaea and Erectheum appear on white marble. The floor is paved with rectangular slabs of Dionessos Pentelic marble with dark vein. Gray Kokinara marble is used for the dado. The room's columns and pilasters, as well as the coffered ceiling, bear painted decorations identical to those used on ancient Greek structures. The artwork was done by Athenian artist Demetrios Kokotsis who used the traditional encaustic painting method, employing earth colors and beeswax applied freehand which was then overlaid with 24-carat gold leaf rubbed on by polishing bones which required two men more than seven months to complete. White oak furniture, patterned after designs on Greek vases, is decorated with gold-leaf carvings and sunburst inlays of ebony. Student chair backs carry the names of Greek islands and towns. The professor's and guests' chairs bear the names of Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates. A line from Homer's Iliad exhorts students to strive for nobility and excellence. The deep red wall color is repeated in the drapery valance with its Greek key design. Archives in the alcove cabinet record visits by the Queen of Greece, and by ecclesiastic and diplomatic officials.  In 1940, one of two marble pilasters for the room that was being constructed in Greece from the Mt Pentele stone quarry used to build the Parthenon, cracked shortly before shipping to the United States. With an invading World War II army massing on its borders, the column could not be replaced. Greek architect John Travlos ordered a matching crack etched into the undamaged column in order to preserve the symmetry. The marble was transported on the last ship to sail to America prior to the invasion and occupation of Greece. In November 1941, Travlos crouched under a blanket in his apartment closet listening to banned BBC radio broadcasts. Suddenly, Greek ecclesiastical music spouted from the radio, and Travlos heard the people of Pittsburgh dedicate his memorial to Greece.","A Greek classroom in Athens, featuring marble columns, painted decorations, and Greek-themed furniture, with a deep red wall color and historical artifacts."
"Dénes Györgyi, a professor at the Industrial Art School in Budapest, won the Hungarian Classroom design competition sponsored by Hungary's Ministry of Education in 1930 which features Magyar folk art combined with deep wood carvings and historic stained glass windows.  The walls of the room are oak veneer stained a soft tobacco brown.  The wood in the panels was carefully selected and matched, so that the natural grains form interesting decorative patterns.  The ceiling is 70 wooden cazettas suspended in a wooden frame and has a predominant hue of ""paprika red"", a color inspired by the peppers which are hung to dry over white fences in Hungary.  The cazettas are decorated with folk motifs (birds, hearts, and tulips) in turquoise, green, and white were painted by Antal Diossy in Budapest.  Joining the ceiling and walls is an inscription frieze with the first two stanzas of Himnusz, the Hungarian National Anthem by Ferenc Kölcsey. Above the blackboard is the coat of arms of the University of Buda which was founded in 1388.  At the top is the crown of St. Stephen, the patron saint of Hungary and its first Christian king.  The student seats are made of oak and are unadorned except for stylized carved tulip ornaments on the back.  A bench along the rear wall and guest chairs are upholstered in blue.  Along the corridor wall, panels carved with floral, plant, and bird designs invoke a ""tulip chest"" which are the traditional hope chests of Hungarian village brides that are decorated with tulips.  In the display case lined with soft blue velvet is an exhibit of Hungarian porcelain, lace, embroidery, and costumed dolls.  Stained and painted glass windows depict the legend of Hungary's founding as well as important events in the nation's history and culture. The rear window depicts King Nimrod and his sons, Hunor and Magor, who pursued a white stag from the east to the fertile Danube plain. Descendants of Hunor became the Huns and those of Magor became the Magyars. The bay windows commemorate historic figures and events of the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and 17th and 19th centuries. The oak entrance doors bears deep carvings of tulips, pomegranate leaves, daisies, and wheat.  The door's center panel states the date of the room's completion in 1938. The carvings were made by American wood carvers of Hungarian birth from plaster models that were made in Budapest to ensure Magyar authenticity.","A 1930s Hungarian classroom designed with folk art, wood carvings, and stained glass windows."
"The Indian Classroom is modeled on a typical 4th–9th century AD courtyard from Nalanda University, a Buddhist monastic university in Nalanda. At its peak, the university's five temples and 11 monasteries covered 32 acres (130,000 m2) and attracted thousands of students from all over Asia. The room depicts a classroom courtyard at Nalanda. The pale rose bricks, specially fabricated to reflect the hue and texture of the original, form the walls, floor, pilasters, and niches. Six stone columns decorated with rosettes, swags, and fruit echo those found at Nalanda. The rear sculpture wall, a scaled down version of one at Nalanda's Stupa #3, bears images of six Bodhisattvas. Flanking display cases hold replicas of ancient bronze sculptures found at the site. A watercolor triptych depicts male and female students at Nalanda as scholar-monk Silabhadra says farewell to 7th-century Chinese traveler Xuanzang. Gurus taught classes in the courtyards, which were surrounded by residential cells. The cherry wood chalkboard doors and flanking cabinets bear carved seals of Nalanda University with recumbent deer above a Sanskrit inscription. Cast steel grilles in front of the windows, hand wrought into forms which reflect decorative elements of the columns, filter the light and soften the view of the 20th-century outside world. Renaissance 3 Architects received the Master Builders Association Craftsmanship Award for its construction.","The document describes an Indian classroom modeled after a 4th-9th century AD courtyard from Nalanda University, a Buddhist monastic university in Nalanda, India."
"The Irish Classroom is the smallest of the Nationality Rooms. The limestone room is designed in Irish Romanesque style, which flourished from the 6th to the 12th centuries and is similar in type, size, and materials to oratories first built on the west coast of Ireland. Adapted from Killeshin Chapel in County Carlow, the triangular doorway gable is carved with human and animal masks against a background of zig-zag and beaded designs. The blackboard frame's pendental arches are carved with foliage, images of wolfhounds, and stylized cat masks. On the opposite wall a sculptured stone chest, under a monumental recessed arch, is patterned after a bishop's tomb in Cormac's chapel. Its ornate sculpture depicts the ""Great Beast"", a greyhound-like animal wreathed in interlaced ornaments. On the chest rests a replica of the Gospels from the Book of Kells. The wrought-iron case bears bird and beast designs drawn from the Book of Kells.  Stained-glass windows, created in 1956/7 by the Harry Clarke Studios in Dublin, portray famous teachers at three of Ireland's oldest centers of learning; St. Finnian at Clonard, St. Columkille at Derry, and St. Carthach at Lismore. Illuminations in the Book of Kells inspired the chair design, except for the wolfhound heads. The oak-beamed ceiling is characteristic of Irish oratories. The cornerstone, from the Abbey of Clonmacnoise, is carved with the Gaelic motto, ""For the Glory of God and the Honour of Ireland."" The cornerstone conceals a container of earth from Northern Ireland (County Armagh) and the Republic of Ireland (County Meath). The room was designed by Harold G. Leask, the former Inspector of National Monuments with The Office of Public Works (The O.P.W.) in Ireland.
Gov. David L. Lawrence, Art Rooney Sr., founding owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and James W. Knox, a member of the Pittsburgh Irish community, were on the room's organizing committee. After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy ordered a Marine guard to deliver the Oval Office Presidential and American flags to Evelyn Lincoln, private secretary to the president. In her will, Lincoln bequeathed the flags to the University of Pittsburgh for the Irish Room in honor of Knox. The John F. Kennedy scholarship for study in Ireland and a James W. Knox endowment for graduate study abroad were created from the proceeds generated from their auction.","The Irish Classroom is a Nationality Room designed in Irish Romanesque style, featuring stained-glass windows, sculptures, and historical artifacts related to Irish education and culture."
"The Israel Heritage Classroom reflects the simplicity of a 1st-century Galilean stone dwelling or house of assembly, this room's benches are patterned after those in the 2nd–3rd-century synagogue of Capernaum. The Ten Commandments, carved in Hebrew, grace the oak entrance door.  Grapes, pomegranates, and dates on the stone frieze, copied from Capernaum, represent crops grown in the Galilee. On the window wall, an inscription discovered in the 6th-century Rehob synagogue cites the Talmudic laws governing the growing of crops each seventh year. A scroll fragment in the rear case replicates the Dead Sea Isaiah Scroll segment which contains the prophecy ""They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks..."" Ancient wine jars flank the scroll. The professor's table, based on one found in Jerusalem's 1st-century burnt house, stands before a copy of the only existing stone Menorah which served as a functional candelabrum. The quotation on the chair reads: ""I learned much from my teachers, more from my colleagues, and most of all from my pupils."" Three segments from the 6th-century Dura Europos murals grace the chalkboard doors, Ezra the Scribe, reads the law; Moses brings forth water for the 12 tribes; and the sons of Aaron consecrate the Temple. Oak benches bear the names of the 12 tribes of Israel. The floor mosaic replicates one in the 6th century Galilean synagogue of Beth Alpha.","The Israel Heritage Classroom is a replica of a 1st-century Galilean stone dwelling or house of assembly, featuring ancient artifacts and inscriptions related to Jewish life and agriculture in the region."
"The Italian Classroom reflects the serenity of a 15th-century Tuscan monastery, with its traditional devotion to religion, art, music, and education. The rear choir stall bench and shuttered windows introduce the monastic theme. The blackboard doors recall an armadio, a cabinet behind an altar used to hold priestly vestments. The turquoise soffitto a cassettoni (coffered ceiling), embellished with carved, gold-leafed rosettes, was inspired by one originally in the San Domenico Convent at Pesaro. In the architrave, names of famous Italians are inlaid in olive wood. The lettering resembles that used in the inscription on the Arch of Titus in Rome. Bay benches are cushioned in red velvet. The red tile floor is set in a herring-bone pattern similar to that of Florence's Palazzo Vecchio. An original Florentine fireplace, made of sandstone from the quarries of Fiesole, bears the carved Latin inscription, ""O Lord, do not forsake me."" On either side stand Savonarola chairs. Monastery bench designs, adapted for student use, are carved with names and founding dates of Italian universities. The oldest is the University of Bologna, established in 1088. From the front of the room, a bronze bust of Dante Alighieri faces Giovanni Romagnoli's mural of Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia, the first woman in the world to achieve a university degree when she was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1678 by the University of Padua.","The Italian Classroom is a Renaissance-inspired educational space designed to reflect the values and traditions of Italy, featuring elements like a monastic theme, historical references, and unique architectural features."
"The Japanese Nationality Room celebrates traditional Japanese carpentry and woodcraft, evoking the mid-18th century minka which were houses of the non-ruling classes of Japan. This room is representative of minka that might be the residence of an important village leader in a farm village on the outskirts of Kyoto and the design represents the core rooms of the house: a plank-floored ima or household sitting room and the adjacent doma, an area with a compacted earthen floor used as an entry-way, for cooking and as a work space. The doma was also a space for household life, where farm, business and craft activities could be carried out under a roof. In the past it also provided a place for drying grain during rainy weather. A central feature of the room is the massive, rough-hewn beam, the ushibari of Japanese pine, supported by posts at the boundary of the ima and doma elements of the room.  The main beam in this room had been carefully preserved by the carpenters in Japan for many years until a project could be found to appropriately utilize its unique curvature. To accommodate the weight concentrated on the primary post, the daikokubashira, the layout of the room has been designed so that this main post sits directly above the building's existing superstructure. The major posts are made of zelkova, (keyaki), a hardwood with a distinctive grain pattern. The other beams are made of American pine. The posts and beams are connected without nails, using traditional joinery techniques. The ceiling is of bamboo with joined beams which would have allowed for the circulation of warm air from fireplaces below.  The walls mimics the typical mud plaster walls through the use of textured wallpaper and wooden wainscoting for greater durability. The bay window is a structure not in keeping with traditional Japanese design and has been masked with panels that suggest shôji, sliding doors of lattice frames, covered with translucent paper. The ima is suggested with a plank wood floor covering the largest portion of the room.  The floor toward the front of the room is made of a simulated earthen material to represent a portion of the doma where it meets the ima's wooden floor. Although the traditional design would call for the wooden floor to be much higher than the dirt floor, this feature has been eliminated in the classroom for practicality.  Located on the rear wall, is the tokonoma, a raised alcove for the display of treasured objects, flower arrangements, and seasonal decorations. The tokonoma has been built in shoin-style, with shôji along its exterior side. The corner post, tokobashira, is made of ebony and the floor of the tokonoma is tatami. The display cases at the rear of the room and along the interior wall contain artifacts in keeping with the period and include a chagama and furo, an iron kettle with metal charcoal hearth/brazier combination, used in the ""tea ceremony"". While typical minka would have no chairs at all, in keeping with its function as a classroom, the classroom has wooden chairs designed and crafted specifically for students and are consistent in design with the rest of the room. Sliding wooden panels cover the blackboard at the front of the room. The interior surface of the entry door has been modified with a wooden treatment that suggests the sliding door that was the typical entrance to a house of this period.","The Japanese Nationality Room celebrates traditional Japanese carpentry and woodcraft, featuring a plank-floored ima and compacted earthen doma, with a massive ushibari beam and zelkova posts, showcasing the core rooms of a traditional Japanese farmhouse."
"The Korean Nationality Room is based on the 14th century Myeong-nyundang (Hall of Enlightenment), the main building at the Sungkyunkwan in Seoul which served as Korea's royal academy during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties from 918 to 1897. The room mimics the three connected rooms of the Myeong-nyundan with twin oak columns forming a symbolic boundary and a central room featuring a lofted ceiling that contains two hand-carved phoenixes facing a symbolic pearl of wisdom, a design inspired by the royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty.
The room was primarily built off-site in Korea, disassembled, and shipped to Pittsburgh, where it was reassembled in the Cathedral of Learning by Korean carpenters who kept with traditional Korean building practices of not using nails or screws in construction. The room features hand cut and hand engraved Douglas fir and red pine logs from South Korea that include swirling engraved designs based on traditional Korean architecture. Windows are covered with a specially produced paper product made of mulberry tree fiber. A symbolic back door leading to a windowed bay that faces Heinz Chapel alludes to a door in the Myeong-nyudang which leads to the Sungkyunkwan's courtyard. The south wall displays three documents that explain the letters and principles of the Hangul, or Korean alphabet, which was created by the court of Sejong the Great in 1443.  A display niche to the right of the classrooms blackboards contains a book illustrating Crown Prince Hyomyeong's matriculation to Sungkyunkwan in 1817, while another niche displays the Four Treasures of the Study: brush, ink, paper and ink-stone.  Furnishings include freestanding, hard-oak desks by Korean designer Ji-hoon Ha that accommodate two to three students and are specifically designed for laptops.  The room also contains an 85-inch, 3-D LED screen and central speaker system and is the first nationality room to be constructed with such technology.","The Korean Nationality Room is a replica of the Myeong-nyundang hall from the 14th century, featuring hand-carved phoenixes, a lofted ceiling, and traditional Korean materials and craftsmanship."
"The Lithuanian Classroom is dominated by a fresco depicting Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis' famous painting The Two Kings, which portrays the reverence Lithuanians have for their villages. This mural sets the tone for a room that pays tribute to the symbolism and love of nature and home reflected in Lithuanian folk art. The door's wooden planks are laid in a diamond pattern similar to those of many farm structures. At the center of the door is a carved rosette, symbol of fire. Above the entrance, a stylized sun between two horses' heads represents light and sound believed to ward off evil spirits. The white oak molding of intersecting scallops resembles decorations found on farm granaries or kleitis. Names of famous Lithuanians are carved on the frieze above the blackboard. The wall fabric is linen woven in a design called ""The Path of the Birds"". Its frame is of white oak and rare bog oak that acquires its deep hue while submerged in a marshy bog for decades. Lithuanian farmers would thus preserve prime trees in order to make furniture pieces that were treasured as heirlooms. The professor's desk is modeled after a household table and the lectern incorporates details of a spinning wheel spindle. Student chairs are carved with a design found on household utensils. The radiator enclosure is perforated with a design of wild rue leaves, a Lithuanian national emblem. Traditionally, a bride is crowned with a wreath of rue, symbol of chastity. Windows of handpressed glass bear leaded medallions in the form of sun ornaments often found on roadside shrines.","The document describes the architectural features and symbolism of a Lithuanian classroom, highlighting its connection to Lithuanian folk art and traditions."
"The Norwegian Classroom was designed in Oslo in an 18th-century peasant style using Norwegian building techniques, painted decoration, and craftsmanship by architect Georg Eliassen just prior to the outbreak of World War II. Plans for the room were sent on the last ship to leave Petsamo for the United States where they were completed by University Architect Albert A. Klimcheck.  Walls of the main space are paneled with vertical overlapping spruce boards hand-rubbed with wax.  The walls in the front of the room are painted a soft blue and decorated with floral designs reminiscent of the 18th century rosemaling technique.
Because living and bedrooms were often merged into one room during this era, two of the panels swing open as if they would reveal traditional built-in-beds, but instead conceal the blackboard. The room features high-sloped ceilings reflective of those in Nordic peasant homes that keep snow from accumulating during the severe winters. Spruce boards are laid in a herringbone pattern slanting upward to a plane of flat boards decorated by two hand-carved, painted rosettes with a symbol for the midnight sun.  Wooden chandeliers bearing a painted design incorporating ""1945"", the year the room was opened, hang from the flat surfaces.  The professor's section of the room has a low raftered ceiling.
The transition between the two parts of the room is indicated by a corner kleberstone fireplace in which birch logs were burned standing on end to assure that smoke would rise up the chimney.  Windows are of handmade opalescent glass tinted pale yellow.  Since a bay window is not a Scandinavian tradition, the area is plastered, paved with slate, and treated as a traditional alcove. The student tablet armchairs are low-backed and the professor's chair is of a typical Viking design with carved heads of beasts and an intertwining dragon motif that traditionally serves as a symbol that protects against evil.
The room features a century-old grandfather clock with an engraved dial and a case that is painted to match the wall decorations of the smaller room.  Above the rear wall bench and flanked by corner display cabinets decorated with rosemaling, hangs a framed copy of a 1695 Norwegian woolen tapestry depicting the Biblical parable of the five wise and five foolish virgins","The Norwegian Classroom is a historic room designed in 1945 with a mix of traditional and modern elements, featuring a unique combination of Nordic architecture and 18th-century decorative techniques."
"The Philippine Nationality Room began construction on May 3, 2018, overcoming a prior hold on the project since 2011.  The design of the Philippine room is based on a traditional bahay na bato. Meaning ""house of stone"", bahay na bato is a long-lasting type of home that became popular in the Philippines during the years of Spanish rule (mid-1500s to 1898). The room is particularly based on the interiors of the Quema House in the city of Vigan.  The Philippine Nationality Room was designed by Pittsburgh architect Warren Bulseco and Philippine architect Melinda Minerva “Popi” Laudico. Professor Fernando Zialcita, a noted authority on Philippine ancestral houses from Ateneo de Manila University, served as adviser to the project. Filipino-American artist Eliseo Art Silva created paintings for the room.
The room features lattice-patterned windows using capiz shells, a popular alternative to glass in the Philippines. The chairs are backed with solihiya, rattan woven into a sunburst pattern. An etched silver Murano mirror from Europe and a bronze chandelier from the United States highlight the role of imported design in Filipino culture.
Other artifacts showcase pre-Colonial cultures. The Golden Tara is a Hindu sculpture viewed by the Manobo tribe as a protective nature spirit. The Manunggul Jar, excavated from a Neolithic burial site in Palawan, depicts human figures traveling in a boat to the afterlife. The room's ceremonial key, designed by Christopher Purpura, incorporates mythological figures from the Meranao people of Mindanao—the serpent Naga and the bird Sarimanok.","The Philippine Nationality Room, designed by Filipino architects, features traditional bahay na bato elements and incorporates modern design elements like imported Murano mirrors and bronze chandeliers, showcasing both pre-Colonial and contemporary influences."
"The Polish Classroom was inspired by rooms in Kraków's Wawel Castle, for centuries the residence of kings. The Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, and the science that his theories revolutionized, are also a major theme of the room. A replica of the famous Jan Matejko portrait of Copernicus shows him as a young man pursuing his study of the universe from a workshop on the roof of his uncle's house in Allenstein (Olsztyn). In the bay stands an enlarged replica of the 16th-century Jagiellonian globe, one of the oldest existing globes to depict North America as a separate continent. The original globe was only eight inches high and was designed to operate as a clock and calendar. It took a metalsmith in Kraków five years to complete the large globe in this room.
Artists from Kraków also came to Pittsburgh to paint the ceiling of 18-foot (5.5 m) beams with informal geometric Renaissance decorations. The room is illuminated by a bronze chandelier bearing a stylized Polish eagle. The walnut seminar table was copied from one in a state dining room at Wawel Castle. The windows combine hexagonal handmade roundels, similar to those in Wawel Castle, with stained-glass coats of arms representing Polish institutions of higher education. The cornerstone is a fragment of Gothic cornice preserved from the Collegium Maius (1369), the ancient Jagiellonian Library. Poland's music is represented by the original manuscript of Ignace Paderewski's only opera, Manru, which is displayed in the archive cabinet.","The Polish Classroom in Pittsburgh is inspired by the Wawel Castle in Kraków, featuring replicas of historical figures and scientific instruments, along with Renaissance-style ceiling paintings and Polish cultural artifacts."
"The Romanian Classroom was designed in Bucharest by Nicolae Ghica-Budeşti. The carved doorframe is characteristic of stone thresholds of Romanian monasteries and is made is of American limestone selected due to its similarity to Romanian limestone used in the royal palace at Bucharest. The entrance door of the Romanian Classroom is ornately carved oak reminiscent of Byzantine churches in Romania. The words of Vasile Alecsandri, one of the greatest Romanian poets of the 19th century, are carved overhead in the stone door frame from his Ode to the Year 1855: ""The Romanian is like the mighty rock which amidst the waves of the stormy and majestic sea forever remains unmoved."" The floor is laid in square blocks of pink marble imported from quarries at Ruşchiţa. The black boards are set in arched oak panels, carved in a manner of icon screens in Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic Romanian churches. These are separated by carved-twisted rope which suggests the Roman origin of many of Romania's artistic traditions. Ancient original icons from Romania depicting the Virgin and Child, Christ, the Dormition of the Virgin, and Saint Mark are embedded in the upper section of each panel.
White arca paint mixed with color gives the smooth plastered walls a bluish pink tint. A Byzantine-style mosaic embedded in the rear wall, a gift of the Romanian government, was executed by Bucharest ceramicist Nora Steriade in gold, turquoise, bronze, ruby red, and black pieces of glass, and was originally part of the Romanian Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair. The lettering for the inscription and for the entrance text is the work of Alexander Seceni. The mosaic depicts Constantin Brâncoveanu, Prince of Wallachia, who refused to recant the Christian faith even at the cost of his own life and the lives of the male members of his family. The six windows have rounded Romanesque heads reflecting tradition brought from Rome when they conquered the original Dacian settlers in 106 AD.
Two small window casements are deeply recessed and have marble window ledges. The four large center windows, form an alcove shut off from the main part of the room by an iron grilled gates wrought in Romania and hung in an arch. These gates swing back in folded sections against the plastered wall. A slab of polished marble tops the wrought-iron radiator grille. Yellow silk draperies frame the windows and ancient icons befitting the season and holidays are exhibited in the alcove which is reminiscent of an icon shrine in an Orthodox Church.   The student chairs are of dark oak hand-carved by Romanian peasant artisans using simple pocketknives and each splat bears a different design.  The professor's reading desk was adapted from an Eastern Orthodox Church lectern.","The Romanian Classroom in Bucharest features ornate carvings, imported marble floors, and ancient icons, reflecting Romanian cultural heritage and history."
"The Russian Classroom contains folk ornamentation with traditional motifs from Byzantium, the spiritual center of Russia.  The seminar table is made of oak slabs matched in contrasting grain and held together by ornamental keys. The cut-out apron is characteristic of massive tables in the Vologda district. The back of each student's chair has a cruciform circle pattern surmounted by triangles carved with symbols of regional or stylistic significance including the reindeer which symbolizes the tundra and the sturgeon that represents the Volga River.  The professor's chair has a back of spirals surmounted by two peacocks worshipping the tree of life.  The podium is ecclesiastic in character and suggests the analoi used in Orthodox churches to support heavy Bibles. The blackboard is patterned after a triptych, or three-leafed frame which holds icons.
The doors of the blackboard are a grille of wooden spirals backed by red velvet.  Above them is a carved panel with Sirin and Alcanost, the twin birds of Russian folklore that depict joy and sorrow as indistinguishable. A dado or low wainscot of simple horizontal oaken boards surrounds the room and incorporates the blackboard, the corner cupboard, and kiot which is a Slavic term for a wall frame treated as a piece of furniture. Within the kiot hangs a vishivka (appliqué and embroidery) banner of Saint George, patron saint of Moscow since the 15th century. The banner was made with pieces of 16th and 17th century fabric from Venice and Paris and is an example of needlework once popular with the Russian aristocracy.  The words ""Valorous youth victorious over forces of evil and darkness"" are carved in both Russian and English below the banner. A copy of the Avinoff family icon in the room depicts the miraculous saving of the city of Kitej from a Tartar invasion in the 14th century.  The ceiling is cornered with designs resembling those used to form traditional Easter cakes and which symbolize the four seasons, with a bud for Spring, a sunflower for summer, grapes for Autumn, and a pine cone for Winter. A wrought iron chandelier was created by Russian-born Hyman Blum.
Following a visit from Dmitry Medvedev in 2009, a display cabinet with carved ornamentation matching the rooms original carvings was installed to house three gifts presented by the then Russian President.","The Russian Classroom is adorned with traditional Byzantine motifs, ornate furniture, and intricate decorations reflecting Russian culture and history."
"The Scottish Classroom was designed by Reginald Fairlie of Edinburgh in the period style of the early 17th century.  The woodwork is carefully selected and treated English pollard oak.  The names of distinguished Scots are carved in the ribbon bands of the panels and include David Livingstone who was an African missionary and explorer, Robert Louis Stevenson who authored Treasure Island, and Alexander Fleming who discovered penicillin.  The inscriptions above the doors and the rear cabinet are from ""The Brus"" by the 14th-century Scottish poet John Barbour.  The room's oak doors were copied from the entrance of Rowallan Castle in Ayrshire.  A 16th-century Scottish proverb above the blackboard was taken from the Cowgate in Edinburgh and is known as ""the Scottish Golden Rule"" which reads: ""Gif Ye did as Ye sould Ye might haif as Ye would."" The plaster frieze was adapted from the plaster frieze at Elcho Castle in Perthshire and incorporates symbols of 14 Scottish clans which had members on the room committee, such as the buckle of the Leslie Clan.  The thistle, Scotland's national flower, is rendered on the cornerstone as a tree-of-life.  The overmantel of the Scottish sandstone fireplace that is flanked by carved kists, or log storage chests, is dominated by a portrait of poet Robert Burns that is copied from an original by Alexander Nasmyth which hangs in the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland.  Above the portrait is the cross of St. Andrew, Scotland's patron saint. The bronze statuettes on the mantel near an arrangement of dried heather are miniature replicas of heroic statues at the gateway to Edinburgh Castle and represent the 13th-century patriot Sir William Wallace and the 14th century freedom fighter, Robert the Bruce, both of whom were popularized in the movie Braveheart.
Medallions in the bay windows represent the coats of arms of the four ancient Scottish universities: Glasgow, St. Andrew's, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh.  The medallions in the front and rear windows are of Elgin and Melrose Abbeys which were 13th and 16th century seats of learning.  The draperies are of crewel-embroidered linen.  The rooms lighting fixtures were inspired by an iron coronet in Edinburgh's John Knox Museum that was retrieved from the battlefield of Bannockburn at which Scotland won its independence from England in 1314.  Student's seats resemble a chair that belonged to John Knox.  An old Scottish church furnished the pattern for the reading stand.  The rear cabinet, based on an aumbry or weapon closet, contain artifacts such as pewter and china used at Soutar's Inn in Ayrshire that was frequented by Robert Burns. The panels in the doors, mantel, and in-the-wall cabinets were carved in Edinburgh by Thomas Good and then shipped to Pittsburgh.  The cabinetwork was done in the shops of Gustav Ketterer of Philadelphia. Wrought ironwork was done by Samuel Yellin.  Cut into stone above the doorways are the thistle and the Lion Rampant, the Scottish emblem incorporated into Britain's royal arms. The chairman of the original Scottish Classroom Committee was Jock Sutherland.","The Scottish Classroom is a historical and artistic masterpiece featuring carved woodwork, inscriptions, and replicas of famous Scottish figures, all designed to honor Scotland's rich history and culture."
"The Swedish Classroom reflects a peasant cottage and contains murals painted by Olle Nordmark. The special glory of the room is the rear wall paintings. The inspiration for the four framed paintings came from painted panels done by the 18th-century painter from Hälsingland, Gustav Reuter. Linton Wilson found the panels at the Nordic Museum.
The hooded brick fireplace derives from an original in the Bollnäs Cottage in Skansen, the famous outdoor museum in Stockholm. The brilliant white walls and fireplace are constructed of 200-year-old handmade bricks. The fire tools were handwrought by Ola Nilsson, a Swedish blacksmith. He reconstructed tools used in his childhood home in Sweden.
A subtle sense of humor associated with the Swedish people is revealed in the room's paintings. A wall fresco secco depicts the Three Wise Men dressed as cavaliers riding to Bethlehem, in two directions. In their midst is Sweden's patron saint, St. Catherine. The sloped ceiling bears decorations in which the central figure is the Archangel Gabriel, seen as a droll trumpeter with two left feet. Nearby are renditions of Justice and Knowledge surrounded by groupings of flowers. Justice uses her blindfold to hold scales that appear balanced but have an off-center fulcrum. Knowledge seems puzzled as she contemplates writing on her slate with a quill pen.
Furniture and woodwork are the work of Erik Jansson of Philadelphia. The classroom's oak furniture is stained a muted gray-blue tone, similar to that found in old Swedish homes. Floral designs, in colors that complement the amber tone of fir wall benches, brighten the door and archive cabinet. The red brick floor is set in a herringbone pattern.","The Swedish Classroom, featuring murals by Olle Nordmark and original fire tools crafted by a Swedish blacksmith, showcases a blend of historical and humorous elements inspired by 18th-century panels from Hälsingland."
"The Swiss Classroom is modeled after a 15th-century room from Fraumunster Abbey displayed in the Swiss National Museum in Zurich, Switzerland. The room is paneled in pine wood and features four white oak trestle tables and four display cases that represent the four languages of Switzerland: French, German, Italian, and Romansch.  26 country-style chairs contain painted carvings of the symbols of Switzerland's cantons that form the Swiss Confederation which united in 1291. The furniture and woodwork were crafted by Richard Sink of French Creek, WV.
A centerpiece of the room is a reproduction of a cocklestove that is modeled on a H.H. Graaf family oven on display in Schloss Wülflingen Castle, Winterthur. The cocklestove's ornate tiles contain several painted Swiss motifs that including various animals, plants, edelweiss, the heraldic emblem of the Graaf family, and a depiction of the Swiss legend of William Tell. Windows are leaded and feature three stained-glass shields of the original Swiss cantons as well as the Swiss Cross.
The Swiss Cross is also displayed stone over the door, within the window of the door, and on the lectern which is modeled on a 17th-century schoolmaster's desk. A carved and painted frieze depicts Swiss flora and fauna and an antique map depicts Switzerland by its ancient Latin name of ""Helvetia"". Portraits on the back wall, done in the style of Hans Holbein the Younger, depict Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. Wood beamed ceiling contains LED lights that are hidden behind rosettes.","The Swiss Classroom is a replica of a 15th-century room from Fraumunster Abbey, featuring furniture and woodwork crafted by Richard Sink, and displays of Swiss motifs, canton symbols, and historical figures."
"Originally a library built in 1782 in a wealthy Damascan merchant's home, the Syria-Lebanon Room was moved intact to its location in the Cathedral of Learning following a six-year effort to fund and install the room by the Syrian and Lebanese communities in Pittsburgh. Because of the fragility and pricelessness of the furnishing, it has been closed for class use and is one of two display rooms. The linden-paneled walls and ceilings are decorated with ""gesso painting,"" a mixture of chalk and glue applied by brush in intricate relief, then painted and overlaid with silver and gold leaf. The room features a (now improperly oriented) mihrab with a stalactite vault traditionally housing the Koran and prayer rug. Set in the walls are book cabinets and display shelves. The room is illuminated by an old mosque lamp of perforated copper with handblown glass wells that originally held oil, water, and wicks. The sofas, from the Arabic word ""suffah"", are covered in satin and rest on a dark red and white marble foundation. The marble floor slopes down at the entrance where visitors would remove their shoes before entering. In 1997, a glass-paneled French-style door to the room was added to allow the room to be visible from passers-by.  The doors were patterned after a grille design found on the windows of the 18th century Ibn Room in the Islamic section of the Metropolitan Museum in New York City.","The Syria-Lebanon Room, a 1782 library in a Damascan merchant's home, was moved to the Cathedral of Learning in Pittsburgh and features intricate gesso painting, a mihrab, and a French-style door inspired by the Metropolitan Museum's Ibn Room."
"The Turkish Nationality Room was based on a baş odası, or main room, of a typical Turkish house or hayat with an outer gallery and a side iwan. The iwan is intended to be used as an entrance area similar to the royal pavilion, annexed to the Yeni Mosque in the Eminönü district of Istanbul, which was built in 1663 for the use of Sultan Mehmet IV. In the iwan of the Turkish Nationality Room, four ceramic panels, painted on clay tiles in Ankara, represent various cultures and points in Turkish history. The largest ceramic is a portrait of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey, who is depicted instructing the nation on the Turkish alphabet adopted in 1928. Other panels depict Uighur princesses, who represent the importance of women in circa 9th-century Turkish culture, a reproduction of ""Two merchants in conversation"" by Mehmed Siyah Kalem which signifies the appearance of realism in Turkish drawing around the 14th century; and a depiction of Suleiman the Magnificent at the circumcision ceremony of Şehzade Beyazıt and Şehzade Cihangir which represents the apex of Ottoman power and culture in the 16th century.  The main room attempts to convey the theme of democracy with its seating distributed around the perimeter of the room which suggests that all occupants are equals. Hardwood seats mimic divan-style seating found in a typical baş odası with back panels that function as writing tablets which when retracted form a ""parted curtain"" motif, a common shape used for household wall niches. The room's ceiling, modeled after the Emirhocazade Ahmet Bey summer house in Safranbolu, is a combination of traditional çitakâri and kündekâri carpentry art that creates intricate geometric patterns using small pieces of wood attached without metal fasteners or glue. Clear glass windows along one wall frame a painted mural depicting a panoramic view of Istanbul which is feature similar to that seen in the mirrored room of the Topkapi Palace. The stained glass windows depict a tulip shape which served as a symbol of the Ottomans in the 18th century.  Display cases contain historic examples of Turkish calligraphy, ceramics, jewelry, miniatures and textiles as well as an evil eye. The entrance symbol above the exterior door depicts the current flag of Turkey, adopted in 1936.","A Turkish Nationality Room, modeled after a typical Turkish house, features ceramic panels representing various cultures and historical periods, including Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Uighur princesses, and Suleiman the Magnificent, with a ceiling decorated with intricate geometric patterns and a mirrored room with tulip-shaped stained glass windows."
"The Ukrainian Classroom is designed in Baroque style with richly carved wood, colorful ceramics, and intricate metalwork in this adaptation of a nobleman's reception room. The entrance has an archaic trapezoidal form with carved motifs of water (chevron), wheat, and sunflowers. The lintel inscription commemorates Ukraine's millennium of Christianity (988–1988). The stove tiles depict festival practices and daily life. A pokutia, or place of honor, is defined by the benches and the traditional icons of St. Nicholas, the Mother of God, Christ the Teacher, and St. George.
The chalkboard doors bearing the Tree of Life are surmounted by three Cyrillic alphabets used in Ukraine in the 11th, 17th, and 19th centuries. On the right wall, a copper bas-relief depicts the development of Ukrainian culture over the millennia. It portrays cultural centers, historical figures, rituals, monuments, and the evolution of Ukrainian ornament. The massive crossbeam's elaborate carvings include a protective solar symbol and a quotation from Ukraine's bard Taras Shevchenko (1814–1861): ""Learn, my brothers! Think and read ... Learn foreign thoughts, but do not shun your own country!""  Beyond the wood posts, reminiscent of a gallery, the display case houses traditional Ukrainian art and crafts.","The Ukrainian Classroom is a Baroque-style building featuring intricate decorations, historical artifacts, and cultural depictions, showcasing Ukraine's rich heritage."
"The Welsh Classroom, was perhaps the longest in coming, as reservations for a Welsh room were originally requested in the 1930s. The existing room, installed on the third floor of the Cathedral of Learning, is patterned after the Pen-rhiw Chapel at St Fagans National History Museum near Cardiff and represents a traditional 18th-century Welsh chapel, which often became the center of village social life.  By that time, the English ruled the country and imposed law requiring English as the official language of the courts and churches.  In order to worship and hold church services in their native Welsh language, and spurred on by the non-conformist movement started by the Protestant Reformation, the Welsh people met in secret locations such as barns or homes, as suggested by the simple white walled chapel modeled in this Nationality Room.  The minister would live at one end as depicted by the display case with dishes and pottery that would be found in a Welsh kitchen and the long oak case clock seated on a Welsh slate foundation opposite the main blue door.  The clock, considered one of the most important furnishings in a Welsh home, has, instead of numbers, a painted square face that spells out ""Richard Thomas"" suggesting that he was both the maker and owner of the clock. The bay window serves as the focus of the Welsh chapel worship, including a blue raised pulpit with a view of the entire congregation and two Deacon's benches from which to monitor the actions of the minister and congregation.
At the other end of the room is a table bearing a lectern, as such worship places would often become a school room for both children and adults during week days.  Above the chalk board is the Lord's Prayer, written in Welsh. Pew benches of pine face the lectern.  Along the wall, larger and more comfortable blue-painted pew boxes with wooden floors, often also serving as barn cattle stalls, would have served wealthier families who would sometimes bring straw, blankets, hot bricks, or dogs to keep them warm. To reflect the simplicity of such meeting places, the ceiling beams are made of poplar and flooring suggests a typical chapel dirt floor.  The carved stone dragon over the doorway, the long-time Welsh national symbol, represents the legendary victory of the Red Dragon over the White Dragon of numerous tales of medieval Welsh literature and represents the triumph of Good over Evil.","The Welsh Classroom is a replica of a traditional 18th-century Welsh chapel, designed to honor the country's history and culture, despite the imposition of English as the official language."
"The Yugoslav Classroom was designed by Professor Vojta Braniš, a sculptor and director of the Industrial Art School in Zagreb.  The walls are paneled in Slavonian oak and hand-carved with geometric figures and the old Slavonic heart design which is combined with a running geometric border, a favorite with South Slavs.  This type of work, known as ""notch-carving"", was traditionally done with a penknife as pastime of peasants.  On the corridor wall is a specially designed coat of arms featuring a double-headed eagle symbolizing the religious influences of Eastern Empire of Byzantium and Western Empire of Rome along with the founding dates of the universities in Belgrade, Ljubljana, and Zagreb.  The ceiling is carved with intricate Croatian, Slovenian, and Serbian folk motifs and the wooden chandeliers are similar to those in the White Palace in Belgrade. The professor's chair and guests chairs were carved by students at the International Art School in Zagreb, and each spindle of the chairs bears a different notched design.  At the window, a bronze sculpture by Vojta Braniš, ""Post-War Motherhood"", depicts a barefoot mother nursing her child whom she has protected during the long months of war.  In the display cabinet is a lace portrayal of the Madonna of Brežje by Slovenes Leopoldina Pelhan and her student Mila Božičkova which took six months to complete and was inspired by the story of a lace Madonna created by the villagers of Sveta Gora in order to replace a priceless painting during World War I. The ceiling squares contain one of the three alternating ceiling ornaments suggesting flowers, stars, the sun, and other radiating geometric patterns, which are organized into a matrix of 9 by 7 squares.
Above the paneled walls, six portraits depict prominent Yugoslavs. On the front wall are portraits of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787–1864) who compiled the Serbian dictionary and collected, edited, and published Serbian national ballads and folk songs; and Croatian statesman Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer (1815–1905) who was known for his efforts to achieve understanding between the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, founder of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (now the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts). On the corridor wall are likenesses of Baron George von Vega (1754–1802), a Slovenian officer in the Austrian army and mathematician recognized for various works including a book of logarithm tables; and Petar Petrović Njegoš (1813–1851), the last prince-bishop of Montenegro, who was celebrated for his poetry.  Represented on the rear wall are Rugjer Bošković (1711–1787), a Croatian scientist distinguished for his achievements in the fields of mathematics, optics, and astronomy; and France Ksaver Prešeren (1800–1849) who is considered one of the greatest native-language Slovenian poets.
The Yugoslav Classroom's executive committee was first organized in 1926 under the chairmanship of Anton Gazdić, the president of the Croatian Fraternal Union. After his death in September 1933 the new chairman was Steve Babić, the previous vice-chairman, and the new vice-chairwoman became Catherine Rušković McAleer. Famous Croatian sculptor Ivan Meštrović was a great supporter of the Classroom and gave two of his works to the university, one a bust of Mihajlo Pupin and the other a self-portrait. The Classroom was designed to portray the culture and traditions of the Yugoslavs, who were considered as inhabitants of the various Yugoslavian regions: Croatians, Dalmatians, Slavonians, Slovenians, Serbians, Bosnians and Montenegrins.","The Yugoslav Classroom is a museum designed to showcase the cultural heritage of the Yugoslavian region, featuring sculptures, paintings, and artifacts reflecting the history and traditions of its inhabitants."

"Two of the Carnegie museums, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the Carnegie Museum of Art, are both located in the Carnegie Institute and Library complex in Oakland, a landmark building listed on the National Register of Historic Places (ref #79002158, added 1979). It also houses the Carnegie Music Hall and the main branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. 

Andrew Carnegie donated the library and the buildings. With the goal of inspiring people to do good for themselves and their communities, the terms for donations required communities to support them in exchange for the building and initial investment by Carnegie. The words ""free to the people"" inscribed above the entrance of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh illustrate his vision. The other two museums, The Andy Warhol Museum and the Kamin Science Center, are located in separate facilities on Pittsburgh's North Shore.","The Carnegie Institute and Library complex houses multiple museums including the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Music Hall, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh."
"Opened on May 15, 1994, the Andy Warhol Museum is the first museum to exclusively focus on an American postwar artist. The building which houses the Andy Warhol Museum was originally built in 1911 for industrial purposes, but was redesigned for the museum by architect Richard Gluckman. The museum currently has seven floors of gallery and exhibition space as well as an underground education studio and conservation lab. 
Warhol's primary artistic technique was silkscreen pop art, which he gained notoriety for in the early 1960s. The serial images derived from the culture's consumerism and conception of beauty are reified in a form of art which represent the identity of constituents in postwar American society. Images used by Warhol, which have made him famous for his contributions to pop art, include celebrities and consumables such as Marilyn Monroe and The Campbell's soup can. 
The museum's collection includes over 4,000 Warhol art works in all media—paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculptures, and installation; the entire Andy Warhol Video Collection, 228 four-minute Screen Tests, and 45 other films by Warhol; and extensive archives, including Warhol's Time Capsules. While dedicated to Andy Warhol, the museum also hosts many exhibits by contemporary artists.","The Andy Warhol Museum is a museum dedicated to the work of American postwar artist Andy Warhol, featuring his iconic silkscreen pop art and hosting exhibits by contemporary artists."
"When Andrew Carnegie envisioned a museum collection consisting of the ""Old Masters of tomorrow,"" the Carnegie Museum of Art arguably became the first museum of modern art in the United States. The museum was founded as the Department of Fine Arts, Carnegie Institute in 1895. The name was changed to its current name in 1986.
Today the museum continues showcasing contemporary art by staging the Carnegie International exhibition every three to five years. Numerous works from the International exhibitions have been acquired for the museums' permanent collection including Winslow Homer's The Wreck (1896) and James A. McNeill Whistler's Arrangement in Black: Portrait of Señor Pablo de Sarasate (1884).
The Hall of Sculpture, constructed in white marble, replicates the interior of the Parthenon. The Hall of Architecture contains the largest collection of plaster casts of architectural masterpieces in America and one of the three largest in the world. Opened in 1974, the Sarah Scaife Galleries Annex was designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and Associates. The Sarah Scaife Foundation gift nearly doubled the exhibition square footage. The modernist addition was designed to not compete with the existing building. Trustee James L. Winokur says of architect Edward Larrabee Barnes, ""He kept the old building out front. He was not terribly concerned about getting credit, just concerned about doing the job right, and he did do it right.""
The Heinz Architectural Center, opened as part of the museum in 1993, is dedicated to the collection, study, and exhibition of architectural drawings, prints and models. Most of these are from the 19th and 20th centuries. 
In 2001 the museum acquired the archive of African-American photographer Charles ""Teenie"" Harris, consisting of approximately 80,000 photographic negatives spanning from the 1930s to the 1970s. Many of these images have been cataloged and digitized.
The museum's permanent collection includes European and American decorative arts from the late seventeenth century to the present, works on paper, paintings, prints (most notably Japanese prints), sculptures and installations.","The Carnegie Museum of Art, founded in 1895, is the first museum of modern art in the United States, showcasing contemporary art through the Carnegie International exhibition and maintaining a diverse collection of European and American decorative arts, works on paper, paintings, prints, and sculptures."
"Opened alongside the Carnegie Museum of Art in 1895, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History is currently home to over twenty million objects and artifacts. Carnegie oversaw the collecting from 1895 to 1907 and it reflected his ideas of evolutionary development.
Most notably, it houses a collection of 230 dinosaur fossils—including the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex known to date—as well as exhibits such as Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems, Alcoa Foundation Hall of American Indians, and Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt. The museum's Powdermill Nature Reserve was established in 1956 to serve as a field station for long-term studies of natural populations, and now forms the core of the museum's Center for Biodiversity and Ecosystems. Research teams that included Carnegie scientists have made discoveries such as Puijila darwini and Hadrocodium wui.","The Carnegie Museum of Natural History, opened in 1895, houses a vast collection of dinosaur fossils, minerals, and exhibits, including the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex, and supports biodiversity research."
"Opened in 1991, but with a history that dates to October 24, 1939, the Kamin Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh.  The Kamin Science Center houses the Buhl Planetarium & Observatory, the Rangos Giant Cinema Theater, and a number of temporary and permanent exhibits, including Highmark SportsWorks, the Miniature Railroad & Village, and the Robot Hall of Fame.
On February 21, 1990, Pennsylvania Senator John Heinz introduced Senate Bill S. 2151, which allowed the USS Requin, a World War II submarine, to be transferred as an exhibit for the science center. The purpose of the exhibit is for visitors to learn how people lived and worked on the boat.   
The Buhl Planetarium and larger Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh merged in 1987, leading to an October 1989 groundbreaking on the newly-named Carnegie Science Center building. A large donation by the Kamin family led to the science center's renaming in 2024.","The Kamin Science Center, opened in 1991, is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh, housing attractions like the Buhl Planetarium & Observatory, Rangos Giant Cinema Theater, and various exhibits."
"In July 1965, Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Alan J. Perlis, in conjunction with the faculty from the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA, renamed Tepper School of Business in 2004), staff from the newly formed Computation Center, and key administrators created the Computer Science Department, one of the first such departments in the nation. Their mission statement was ""to cultivate a course of study leading to the PhD degree in computer science, a program that would exploit the new technology and assist in establishing a discipline of computer science."" The educational program, formally accepted in October 1965, drew its first graduate students from several existing academic disciplines: mathematics, electrical engineering, psychology, and the interdisciplinary Systems and Communications Sciences program in the Graduate School of Industrial Administration. The department was housed within the Mellon College of Science.
With support from Newell, Simon, Nico Haberman, Provost Angel Jordan and President Richard Cyert, the computer science department began a two-year status as a ""floating"" department in the early months of 1986.  Then, the Department began to grow, both academically and financially. In 1988, the School of Computer Science was established, among the first such schools in the country. The Computer Science Department was the original department within the school.","The Computer Science Department was established in 1965 as one of the first computer science departments in the United States, with a focus on cultivating a PhD program in computer science."
"During the 1970s the Computer Science Department offered only a PhD study program, with no master's degree as an intermediate step.  The PhD program required a minimum of six years of residency.  It was called the ""do or die"" program among the graduate students, because a student could not drop a PhD and receive a master's degree.  It had quickly focused on computer networking, operating systems (Hydra, Accent, Mach), and robotics.","The Computer Science Department in the 1970s offered a PhD program with a six-year residency requirement, focusing on computer networking, operating systems, and robotics."

"Frick died in 1919 at the age of 69, bequeathing the house as a public museum for his art collection. His widow Adelaide Howard Childs Frick continued living in the mansion with her daughter Helen; if Adelaide died or moved away, the house would be converted to a public museum. At the time, the collection alone was worth $30 million, and Frick also provided a $15 million endowment for the maintenance of the collection. Nine people, including Adelaide, Helen, and Helen's brother Childs, were named as trustees of his estate; Childs served as the head of the Frick estate's board of trustees until his death in 1965. Per the terms of Frick's will, the trustees moved to incorporate Frick's art collection in April 1920, submitting articles of incorporation to the New York state government. The Frick Collection Inc. was incorporated that month.
The New York and Pennsylvania state governments fought over which government should collect taxes from Frick's estate. Amid this dispute, the collection was reassessed at $13 million in 1921; this figure was repeated in a revised appraisal of Frick's estate that was filed with the New York state government in 1923. Meanwhile, Helen Frick studied plans for the Witt Library in London in the early 1920s, as she wanted to create a library for Frick's personal collection. Helen catalogued most of the collection over the next decade. The Frick Art Research Library, originally named the Frick Art Reference Library, was organized at the mansion after Frick's death, and a dedicated library building opened the next year. During the 1920s, the library added thousands of volumes and photographs to its holdings. Over the years, four additional trustees had to be appointed after their predecessors died.","The Frick Collection was established as a public museum in 1920, with Adelaide Howard Childs Frick as the first trustee, and Helen Frick continued to manage the collection until her death in 1945."
"After Adelaide Frick's death in October 1931, the trustees were finally allowed to open the house to the public; they announced in January 1933 that the collection would likely open to the public within a year. John Russell Pope was hired to alter and enlarge the house. Frederick Mortimer Clapp, who had joined the Frick Collection as an advisor in 1931, was hired as the museum's first director. Work on the mansion began in December 1933. A new library wing was constructed on 71st Street to replace the original library. Other modifications included a new storage vault and renovations of the Frick family's living space. The museum's opening, originally scheduled for 1934, was postponed because of the complexity of the construction project.  The Frick estate also sued the city government in 1935 to obtain a property-tax exemption for the museum, and the taxes were waived the next year, as the Frick Collection was a public museum.
When the rebuilt library opened in January 1935, it had 200,000 photographs, 18,000 catalogs of art sales, and 45,000 books. The museum itself had a soft opening on December 11, 1935; the preview was noteworthy enough that the names of 700 visitors were published in that day's New York Herald Tribune. The Frick Collection officially opened to the public five days later on December 16. When it opened, the museum did not charge admission fees, but staff distributed timed-entry tickets to prevent crowding. Although about 600 tickets were distributed daily to people who showed up in person, other visitors had to make reservations several weeks in advance due to high demand. Ropes were placed throughout the house to force visitors to follow a specific path. The galleries were originally closed on holidays, Sundays, and for a month in the middle of the year. Artworks were arranged based on how they blended in with the house's ambiance, rather than being arranged by year.","The Frick Collection, opened in 1935, was a public museum that featured a rebuilt library and a variety of art collections, including photographs, catalogs, and books."
"Within a year of the museum's opening, demand had declined enough that officials decided to scale down, and then eliminate, its timed-entry ticketing system. The ropes throughout the house were taken down, and visitors were allowed to visit the Frick House's rooms in any order. Museum officials also presented lectures five days a week during the late 1930s, and they started hosting afternoon concert series in November 1938; these concerts and lectures continued throughout Clapp's tenure at the museum. Clapp also obtained fresh flowers each day and placed them in the first-floor galleries for esthetic purposes. Three magnolia trees were planted on the grounds in 1939. To expand their land holdings, museum officials bought a neighboring townhouse at 9 East 70th Street in 1940 and used that building as storage space.
Museum officials constructed a vault in 1941 to protect the artwork from air raids. During World War II, the museum continued to host visitors, but some rooms were closed, and more than five dozen paintings and all of the sculptures were moved into storage. Museum officials took these pieces out of storage in May 1945 and restored them; other artworks in the house were rearranged and cleaned as well. The Frick acquired another townhouse at 7 East 70th Street in 1947 and replaced it with a service wing. By the late 1940s, the museum had cumulatively spent about $2.9 million in acquisitions since Frick's death. When John D. Rockefeller Jr. offered to donate several pieces of artwork in 1948, Helen Frick objected, arguing that the museum only accepted gifts from Frick family members. In the lawsuit that followed, a New York Supreme Court judge ruled that the terms of Frick's will did not prevent the museum from accepting external gifts; the court's Appellate Division upheld this ruling. Rockefeller, who had been on the board of trustees, resigned amid the dispute.
Clapp resigned in 1951 and was replaced by the museum's assistant director Franklin M. Biebel. Biebel established a decorative-arts conservation program, and the number of annual visitors nearly doubled under his tenure. The museum's collection remained largely unchanged over the next several years, as Helen Frick opposed any expansions, saying that her father would not have wanted items to be added. Helen resigned from the museum's board of trustees in 1961, when the board finally voted to accept Rockefeller's gift. Assistant director Harry D. M. Grier replaced Biebel, becoming the museum's third director in 1964. By the mid-1960s, the Frick had 160 portraits, 80 sculptures, and various other items in its collection. The Frick was open six days a week (except in August, when it was closed) and was still free to enter. The collection was small compared to that of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which at the time had 365,000 items. Edgar Munhall was hired as the museum's first chief curator in 1965, a position he would hold for thirty-five years. As part of a master plan in 1967, the Frick's trustees drew up plans for an annex at 7 and 9 East 70th Street.","The Frick Collection underwent significant changes in its management and operations over the years, including the introduction of new programs, the expansion of its land holdings, and the acquisition of additional artworks."
"By the early 1970s, the museum recorded about 800 daily visitors and employed 75 staff members. The next year, the museum began asking visitors to pay an optional admission fee due to rising taxes and expenses. After Grier was killed in a traffic accident in 1972, Everett Fahy was appointed as the museum's fourth director in 1973. The museum announced plans to construct an annex at 5–9 East 70th Street. After the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) expressed concerns over the fact that the expansion would require the demolition of the Widener House at 5 East 70th Street, the museum announced a plan for a ""temporary garden"" on the 70th Street lots, which the LPC approved. The original annex was canceled that November, and Frick officials subsequently decided to build  a one-story wing on the Widener House's site. The annex had been proposed because, at the time, the mansion could accommodate only 250 people at once.
Under Fahy's tenure, the museum began hosting more temporary exhibits, which it had seldom held before Fahy took over. The Frick began charging admission for the first time in 1976. The annex was completed the next year, along with a garden, designed by British landscape architect Russell Page. The Frick renovated the Boucher Room and cleaned and rearranged its paintings during the following decade. By the mid-1980s, the museum displayed 169 works of art, and the galleries occupied 16 rooms. The museum periodically hosted chamber music performances in the Frick House's courtyard. It was relatively low-profile compared to others in New York City, only sporadically expanding its collection and hosting small temporary exhibitions. After Helen Frick died in 1984, the museum took over responsibility for the Frick Art Research Library; initially, the library had no endowment as Helen had not provided anything for the library in her will. Ceiling lights were installed in the Fragonard and Boucher rooms in the 1980s.
Charles Ryskamp, the former director of the Pierpont Morgan Library, was appointed as the Frick's fifth director in December 1986 after Fahy's resignation, though he did not assume that position for another six months. Under Ryskamp's directorship, some of the paintings were rearranged or brought out of storage. By the 1990s, the art reference library was low on funds; the library had a $25 million endowment by 1993, and the Frick began charging ""frequent commercial users"" of the library that year. Through the 1990s, the Frick banned all children under the age of 10, as well as unaccompanied minors between ages 10 and 15, and the museum also did not have a café. The New York City government passed a law banning public institutions from discriminating by age in 1993, which would have forced the museum to start admitting children. Museum officials requested a waiver, saying that they would have to install barriers if children were allowed, and they received such a waiver in 1995. In addition, further lighting upgrades were made in the mid-1990s.
Ryskamp announced his retirement in 1997. After Samuel Sachs II was named as the museum's sixth director that May, the trustees tasked him with raising funds. Under Sachs's directorship, the museum launched a website in the 1990s, and replaced the lighting and hosted additional special exhibitions. Sachs also contemplated expanding the exhibition space, adding a café, and relocating the entrance to the house's garden. In addition, the museum began providing complimentary audio guides for the mansion and artworks and, in the early 21st century, added the Bloomberg Connects smartphone app. Museum officials also began allowing parties to be hosted in the Frick House. A group named Friends of the Fellows of the Frick Collection was formed to raise interest in the museum.","The Frick Collection underwent significant changes under the leadership of directors Everett Fahy and Charles Ryskamp, including the introduction of admission fees, the construction of an annex, and the renovation of galleries and library facilities."
"Colin Bailey was appointed as chief curator in 2000 after Munhall resigned. During the late 1990s, the Helen Clay Frick Foundation proposed moving its archives in Pittsburgh to the Frick Collection's archives, prompting an intra-family debate over whether the collections should be merged. The foundation's collection ultimately was split between the two cities in 2001, and most of the objects were sent to New York City. After attendance dropped following the September 11 attacks that year, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation provided $270,000, in part to fund extended hours on Fridays. Sachs announced in January 2003 that he would resign as the museum's director in eight months, as the board of trustees had not renewed his contract. At the time of Sachs's resignation, the museum recorded 350,000 annual visitors, 20 percent more than in 1997, but it was running at a $1 million annual deficit. Annexes to the museum were proposed in 2001, 2005, and 2008, but all of these plans were canceled because it would have required an extended closure of the museum and still would not have provided sufficient space.
The art scholar Anne L. Poulet was hired in August 2003 as the Frick's first female director, and the museum was reorganized as a tax-exempt public charity shortly after Poulet became the director. Under Poulet's tenure, she replaced lighting in several galleries and rearranged some of the pieces. She also raised $55 million for renovations; the museum's facilities had become dated, and the basement exhibition space was no longer sufficient. Because of the Frick's classification as a charity, the museum had to raise a third of its budget from donations. The Frick created programs to attract major donors and art collectors, and it began charging admission fees for concerts in 2005. During the 2000s decade, the Frick did not acquire many additional items. In contrast to larger museums, it generally hosted small, detailed exhibits, though the number of short-term exhibitions at the Frick increased during the decade. Further restorations of the museum's galleries took place through the late 2000s to attract visitors.

Poulet announced her retirement in September 2010, and Ian Wardropper was hired as the museum's director in 2011. A sculpture gallery, designed by Davis Brody Bond, opened at the Frick House in December 2011, becoming the first new gallery at the museum in three decades. Bailey resigned as the chief curator in 2013, and Xavier F. Salomon was hired as the chief curator the same year. During the 2010s, the Frick began raising $290 million for its renovation. The collection had reached more than 1,100 works by the mid-2010s. In addition, the museum was hosting an average of five temporary exhibits per year. The Frick House's facilities were not adequate for the museum's modern needs. For example, paintings had to be carried into the museum through the house's front door, and portraits had to be placed in storage whenever the Frick hosted a visiting show. The concerts at the museum sometimes sold out as well.
In 2014, the museum announced plans for a six-story annex on 70th Street designed by Davis Brody Bond. Russell Page's garden on 70th Street would have been demolished to make way for the annex; this prompted opposition from residents and preservationists, and the Frick announced in June 2015 that it would draw up new designs. To attract younger visitors, the museum began hosting free events in the mid-2010s, such as First Fridays. The Frick hired Annabelle Selldorf to design a revised expansion plan for the museum, which was announced in April 2018; the LPC approved Selldorf's plans that June. The Frick then sought to relocate to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum temporarily, but the Guggenheim was available for only four months. By September 2018, the Frick was negotiating to take over the Whitney Museum's space at 945 Madison Avenue; the Frick finalized a two-year lease for that building in 2020.","The Frick Collection underwent significant changes under the leadership of Anne L. Poulet, including reorganization, fundraising, and expansion, while also facing challenges such as limited space and opposition to annex plans."
"The Frick closed in mid-March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City; the opening of the temporary location was delayed due to the pandemic. The museum's collection was moved to 945 Madison Avenue, which reopened as the Frick Madison in March 2021. The Frick Madison housed the museum's old masters collection, including 104 paintings, along with sculptures, vases, and clocks. Most of the 1,500-piece collection of artwork was placed in storage at 945 Madison Avenue, and about 300 works were placed on display. At the Frick Madison, the artwork was exhibited against stark dark gray walls, in contrast to the Frick House's ornate decoration; the paintings were also grouped according to their age and region of origin. The Frick Madison also included a café.
The museum had raised $242 million for its capital campaign by the end of 2023. Wardropper announced in January 2024 that he would resign the following year, after the Frick House's renovation was complete. The Frick Madison closed on March 3, 2024. The Henry Clay Frick House and Frick Art Research Library were originally expected to reopen in late 2024, but this was later pushed back to early 2025. In September 2024, the Frick appointed Axel Rüger, the head of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, as the museum's director beginning in 2025.","The Frick Madison opened in March 2021 and housed the museum's collection, including 104 paintings, sculptures, vases, and clocks, until it closed in March 2024."
"Some of the earliest works in Frick's collection were portraits of his family, created for his Pittsburgh residence. At the beginning of the 20th century, Frick bought works such as Rembrandt's Portrait of a Young Artist (possibly the first Old Master painting in the collection), Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot's Ville d'Avray, Constant Troyon's A Pasture in Normandy, and Vermeer's Girl Interrupted at Her Music. From 1905 to 1915, Frick also acquired paintings such as Hals's Portrait of a Woman, Velázquez's Portrait of Philip IV in Fraga, Rembrandt's A Dutch Merchant, and Rembrandt's The Polish Rider.
After Frick had finished his own mansion, he brought over several paintings of his firstborn daughter Martha, who had died in her childhood. He also obtained 14 Fragonard panels from the collection of J. P. Morgan and moved the panels to his house's drawing room. At the time of the house's completion, he owned paintings by such artists as El Greco, Goya, Hals, Rembrandt, Romney, Titian, Anthony van Dyck, and Velázquez.  In the late 1910s, Frick acquired additional pieces from outside the Morgan collection, such as Hans Holbein's portrait of Thomas Cromwell, Rubens's Portrait of the Marquis Ambrose de Spinola, Rembrandt's An Old Woman Reflecting Over the Lecture, and Gainsborough's Mall between 1915 and 1916 alone. He also bought four Boucher panels, although he turned down the opportunity to buy additional panels. From 1917 through 1919, Frick obtained several pieces of Boucher tapestry furniture, Van Dyck's Countess of Clanbrazil, Hals's Portrait of a Man, Vermeer's Mistress and Maid, and a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington.","Frick's collection expanded significantly over the years, acquiring works by various Old Masters and other notable artists."
"In the half-century after Frick died, thirty objects were added to the original collection. After Frick's death but before the opening of the current museum, the Frick estate's trustees bought the Portrait of Comtesse d'Haussonville by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, as well as a painting by Duccio and the Coronation of the Virgin by Paolo Veneziano. The Giuseppe Bastiani painting Adoration of Magi was acquired in 1935. Works by Cimabue, Duccio, della Francesca, and Filippo Lippi entered the museum's collection for the first time between 1924 and 1950. Shortly after the museum opened, it acquired items such as a Renaissance-era panel by della Francesca, a portrait that Boucher painted of his wife, Jacques-Louis David's painting of a French noblewoman, Monet's Vétheuil in Winter, and a Paul Cézanne landscape.  This was followed in the 1950s by three Italian Renaissance paintings, David's portrait of Antonio Bartolomeo Bruni, and Jan van Eyck's Virgin and Child, with Saints and Donor. The collection had only one 17th-century French work until the 1960s, when the museum obtained Claude Lorrain's painting of the Sermon on the Mount; the museum also obtained della Francesca's Crucifixion during that decade.
The Frick did not acquire anything between c. 1968 and 1991, when the museum obtained its first Jean-Antoine Watteau painting, Portal of Valenciennes. The museum's other acquisitions in the 1990s and 2000s included one of Corot's oil sketches, two of Jean-Baptiste Greuze's portraits, and Gabriel de Saint-Aubin's The Private Academy. After former director Ryskamp died in 2010, he bequeathed some of his collection to the Frick. The museum's other acquisitions in the 2010s included a self-portrait by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo that had been owned by Henry Clay Frick's grandson. In 2023, the Frick obtained Giovanni Battista Moroni's painting Portrait of a Lady, the first Renaissance-era portrait of a woman in the collection.","The Frick Collection expanded its collection over five decades through various acquisitions, including works by renowned artists like Ingres, Duccio, and Cimabue, and gained significant holdings in the 1950s and 1960s."
"The modern-day museum's collection includes numerous works of sculpture and porcelain, in addition to 18th-century French furniture, Limoges enamel, and Oriental rugs. The objects in the collection include 18th-century tapestries that belonged to Louis XV and Louis XVI of France.
Frick had acquired some objects from the J. P. Morgan estate specifically to complement the visual art in his collection. Some of these acquisitions included 18th-century French sculptures and furniture, a hawthorn beaker, and Chinese porcelains. In one case, Frick paid $1.5 million for some of Morgan's 44 enamels and 225 bronzes. He also acquired 40 Limoges enamels from Morgan's collection in 1919, one of the last things he would personally purchase. Outside of the Morgan collection, Frick also bought the bronzes Bust of a Jurist by Danese Cattaneo, Antonio Galli by Federico Brandani, and Duke of Alba by Jacques Jonghelinck. Although Frick had planned a sculpture gallery to his home in the late 1910s, the lack of other statuary caused him to cancel the plan. Duveen displayed numerous marble busts in the Frick House while Frick decided whether to buy them.
A bust of Henry Clay Frick by Malvina Hoffman was gifted to the museum when it opened in 1935. Other acquisitions of sculpture in the mid-20th century included a Diana bust by Jean-Antoine Houdon, a 15th-century bronze figure of an angel,  and a pair of 15th-century Italian marble busts.  In the 1990s and 2000s, the Frick received Winthrop Edey's collection of timekeeping pieces, a 19th-century terracotta bust by Joseph Chinard, a marble bust by Houdon; a bust by Massimiliano Soldani Benzi, and a clock. Acquisitions since the 2010s have included 131 Meissen porcelains, as well as 28 objects from collector Alexis Gregory (including rare clocks and enamels).","The Frick Collection's extensive collection includes sculptures, porcelain, furniture, and other decorative arts from various historical periods, reflecting its diverse artistic heritage."
"Temporary exhibitions in the 1970s included an exhibit in honor of the museum's late director Harry D. M. Grier, bronzes by Severo Calzetta da Ravenna, and drawings by Fragonard. Topics of temporary exhibitions during the 1980s included busts by Houdon, French clocks, terracotta sculptures by Clodion, drawings by Ingres, Henry Clay Frick's earliest acquisitions, and Old Master paintings.
Especially in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the museum has hosted temporary exhibitions about singular artworks or artists. Among the items exhibited in the 1990s were works by French painter Nicolas Lancret, watercolors from the Rijksmuseum, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century drawings from the Stanford Museum, a single Claude Monet painting, drawings by German artists, and drawings by French artists. In 1999, several items in the permanent collection were taken out of storage specifically to complement an exhibition of Ingres's Portrait of Comtesse d'Haussonville.","Temporary exhibitions in the 1970s featured works by Harry D. M. Grier, Severo Calzetta da Ravenna, and Fragonard. During the 1980s, exhibitions focused on busts by Houdon, French clocks, terracotta sculptures by Clodion, drawings by Ingres, Henry Clay Frick's acquisitions, and Old Master paintings. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the museum hosted exhibitions about singular artworks or artists, including works by Nicolas Lancret, watercolors from the Rijksmuseum, drawings from the Stanford Museum, Claude Monet paintings, and drawings by German and French artists."
"In the early 2000s, the topics of the Frick's exhibitions included drawings in the collection of the Albertina museum, paintings from John Hay Whitney's collection, El Greco paintings, antique clocks, pieces from the Toledo Museum of Art's collection, a set of Parmigianino paintings, and three consecutive exhibits of antique bronzes. Later in the decade, the temporary exhibitions included portraits by Hans Memling, paintings by Paolo Veronese, a show of French art, the Frick's first Meissen porcelain show, pieces from the Norton Simon Museum's collection, and a single painting by Parmigianino. The Frick hosted various exhibits in honor of its 75th anniversary in 2010, including an exhibition on its own founding. Other early-2010s exhibits included works from the Dulwich Picture Gallery, works from the Courtauld Gallery, Picasso drawings, Renoir paintings, Piero della Francesca panels, and a historical overview of St. Francis in the Desert.
After some works from the Mauritshuis in The Hague were displayed at the Frick in 2013, the Frick displayed several paintings at the Mauritshuis in 2015, marking the first time that the Frick lent paintings to a European museum. During the mid- and late 2010s, the subjects of the Frick's exhibits included paintings from the Scottish National Gallery's collection, paintings from the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence, works by Andrea del Sarto, objects by Pierre Gouthière, and canvases by J. M. W. Turner. When the Frick moved to 945 Madison Avenue in the early 2020s, its exhibits included a showcase of Barkley Hendricks paintings (the museum's first exhibit of a black artist's art) and a pair of paintings by Giovanni Bellini and Giorgio da Castelfranco.",The Frick's exhibitions in the early 2000s featured a variety of artworks from different museums and collections.
"The museum hosts special events, such as academic symposiums, concerts, and classes. The educational programs are led by Rika Burnham, who became head of the museum's education department in 2008. The Frick's educational programs include online visits for students at secondary schools and postsecondary institutions, as well as courses where a single piece is discussed at length. The Frick also has partnerships with local educational partnerships such as the Ghetto Film School. Docents began hosting lectures in galleries in 2010, and the museum launched a mobile app in 2014, allowing visitors to bookmark artworks in the museum's collection. After the Frick closed for renovation, museum officials launched several digital programs, including drawing classes and discussions about artwork.
Every year since 2000, the Frick hosts the Young Fellows Ball, a springtime gala for philanthropists who are largely under age 40. The museum also started hosting an  annual Garden Party in 2008; the event, which began as a members-only gathering, evolved into an annual fundraiser. In 2016, the Frick introduced First Fridays, in which patrons could visit the museum for free on the first Friday of every month. First Fridays include gallery talks and activities for visitors.
The Concerts from the Frick Collection series was launched in 1938 and has continued through the 20th and 21st centuries. Musicians who have performed at the Frick Collection have included Ian Bostridge, Matthias Goerne, Guarneri String Quartet, Wanda Landowska, Gregor Piatigorsky, Artur Schnabel, and Kiri Te Kanawa. The concerts were broadcast on radio starting in 1939, first on the Municipal Broadcasting System, then on American Public Radio and WNYC. Although visitors originally could listen to the concerts free of charge (even after the museum started charging an admission fee), a separate admission charge for concerts was instituted in 2005. Prior to the 2020s renovation, the concerts were hosted in the Frick House's music room.","The Frick Collection offers various educational programs, concerts, and special events, including academic symposiums, classes, and lectures, as well as galas and fundraisers."
"The collection is detailed in books such as Masterpieces of the Frick Collection, first published in 1970, and Art in the Frick Collection, first published in 1996. The history of the collection was also detailed in Henry Clay Frick: An Intimate Portrait, a biography of Frick written by his great-granddaughter Martha Frick Symington Sanger in 1998. Sanger's subsequent book The Henry Clay Frick House: Architecture-Interiors—Landscapes in the Golden Era, published in 2001, described the Frick House and its collection in detail. In 2011, the Frick and the BNP Paribas Foundation published a guidebook on the collection, its history, and the Frick House. The Frick launched its Diptych series in 2017; the series consists of short books with essays that relate to paintings from the museum's collection.","The Frick Collection has been extensively documented through various publications, including biographies, guidebooks, and series of essays related to its art collection and history."
"The museum is ordinarily located at the Henry Clay Frick House at 1 East 70th Street, which is part of Fifth Avenue's Museum Mile. The house spans an entire blockfront on Fifth Avenue between 70th and 71st Streets. The original structure from 1914 was designed by Thomas Hastings in the Beaux-Arts style. The same style is also used for the 1970s reception wing, designed by Harry Van Dyke, John Barrington Bayley, and G. Frederick Poehler. Both structures have a facade of Indiana Limestone. The house has a lawn that is mostly closed to the public.
The interiors were designed by a variety of people. The British decorator Charles Allom furnished most of the rooms on the ground floor, while the majority of the rooms on the second and third floors were decorated by Elsie de Wolfe. Charles Carstairs and Joseph Duveen provided the original decorations for the rooms. Inside the house are the museum's galleries (adapted from the old living spaces of the mansion), as well as a courtyard with reflecting pool, the latter of which is based on a Roman atrium. Some parts of the house have been modified over the years specifically to accommodate the artwork, including a room for the Fragonard panels. In addition to the artwork and artifacts on display, there are bookcases placed throughout the Frick House's rooms, and some rooms have various other pieces of furniture such as a dining table.","The Frick House, located at 1 East 70th Street, is a historic building with a Beaux-Arts facade and a variety of interior designs, including those by Charles Allom and Elsie de Wolfe. The house houses the Frick Collection, featuring art and artifacts displayed in its galleries and courtyard."
"The Frick Collection oversees the Frick Art Research Library, which was established in 1920 and opened to researchers in June 1924. The library is housed at a 13-story building at 10 East 71st Street (next to the original mansion). Prior to the library building's opening, the basement bowling alley was used as storage space for the library's collection. The library has always been open to the public, except during World War II, when it was closed for six months, and during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 renovation, when it was shuttered while being moved to the Frick Madison. The library is typically open free of charge to ""any adult with a serious interest in art"". In the late 20th century, the library served 6,000 people a year on average, most of whom made advance reservations or requests.
Helen Frick acted as director for six decades, during which time its collection expanded to include 50,000 sales catalogs, 400,000 photographs, and 150,000 books. By the 1990s, the library had an estimated 235,000 volumes, which grew to 280,000 by the late 2000s. The collections of the library focus on art of the Western tradition from the fourth century to the mid-twentieth century, and chiefly include information about paintings, drawings, sculpture, prints, and illuminated manuscripts. Archival materials supplement its research collections. The Frick Art Research Library Photoarchive contains over a million photocopies of artwork, including objects that are not in the museum's collection.
The Frick has been part of the New York Art Resources Consortium (NYARC), which also includes the Museum of Modern Art and Brooklyn Museum, since 2007. NYARC operates Arcade, an online catalog that combines the collections of the three museums' libraries. The Center for the History of Collecting, also founded in 2007, is also part of the library. The Frick is a member of the International Consortium of Photo Archives (PHAROS), which operates a database of digitized artworks from the collections of 14 art museums.","The Frick Art Research Library, established in 1920, is a comprehensive resource for art research, housing over 280,000 volumes and focusing on Western art from the fourth century to the mid-twentieth century."
"After the museum opened in 1935, it accommodated 5,000 visitors in its first week and 100,000 visitors in six months; at its peak, the museum saw 1,600 visitors in one day. At the end of 1936, the museum had seen 136,000 visitors, an average of 460 per day. In the 1970s, the museum recorded between 800 and 1,500 daily visitors. The number of annual visitors averaged 250,000 by the late 1990s, and annual attendance had increased to 350,000 by the early 2000s. The Frick Collection had a typical annual attendance of up to 300,000 in the 2010s, although it recorded 420,000 visitors in 2013 due to a particularly popular exhibit there. Shows in the 2010s attracted upwards of 4,000 daily visitors.
The Frick was originally free to enter but has charged an admission fee since 1976. The museum offers pay-as-you-wish hours one day of the week, in addition to free admission on First Fridays. Free admission is also provided to members of the Frick; students and staff of certain universities in New York City; certain demographic groups such as youth, senior citizens, and people with disabilities; and other groups such as military personnel. Frick Collection members receive several membership benefits, including a queue jump for exhibits. As part of the Culture Pass program, persons with cards from New York City's public libraries could also visit the museum for free with a Culture Pass, albeit with restrictions on the number of passes distributed. Until 2019, the Frick also sold the Connoisseur Pass, which also provided admission to the Morgan Library & Museum and Neue Galerie New York.
Children under the age of 10 are not allowed inside the museum; this restriction, intended to protect the paintings, has existed ever since the museum opened in 1935. As part of the same restriction, youths between 10 and 15 years old are allowed to enter only if there is an adult with them. The museum provides guided tours to small groups and school classes. Starting in the late 1990s, the museum provided complimentary audio guides to visitors; it later added the Bloomberg Connects smartphone app. The guides are offered in several languages and consist of handsets that provide information about the artworks and the subjects of each painting. The Frick also launched its website in the late 1990s; the website has been updated several times since then.","The Frick Collection, a museum in New York City, has seen fluctuations in visitor numbers over the years, with a peak of 1,600 visitors per day in its peak period in 1936. Admission fees were initially free but have since been charged since 1976. The museum offers various admission options, including pay-as-you-wish hours and a Culture Pass program."
"Frick's will established a $15 million endowment fund for what would become the Frick Collection museum. At the Frick Collection Inc.'s 50th anniversary in 1970, the museum's endowment had grown to $40 million, and it received more than $1 million a year in income. By 1997, the Frick Collection had an operating budget of $10 million and an endowment of $170 million; this increased in the mid-2000s to a budget of $18.8 million and an endowment of $200 million. As of 2015, the museum had an endowment of $315 million.","The Frick Collection's endowment grew significantly over the years, reaching $315 million by 2015."
"In 1912, before the collection had become a museum, Town & Country magazine wrote that Frick owned ""one of the greatest private collections of paintings in the world"". Art World magazine said in 1917 that the Frick House contained ""one of the most remarkable assemblies of old paintings in the United States belonging to a private collector"", rivaling the collection of the former Lenox Library on the same site. When the Frick Collection opened to the public in 1935, a critic for The New York Times wrote that the museum's ""informality in the distribution of works of art has even its amusing overtones"", while another commentator in The Christian Science Monitor regarded the collection as having ""long been recognized as one of the world's treasuries of art"". One of the few detractors was Lewis Mumford, who felt that the other objects in the house diverted visitors' attention from the visual art.
A Los Angeles Times critic wrote in 1941 that few other art collections in the U.S. ""so completely [exemplified] a great period in American art collecting"".  The New York Times wrote in 1969 that the Frick was one of the world's best ""residence-museums"" along with the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the Wallace Collection. A critic for the Christian Science Monitor said in 1971 that the collection's paintings seemed to fit the building because Frick had ""to be sure he felt at home with them"". Another critic, writing for The Post-Standard of Syracuse, New York, in 1975, praised the museum's ""tranquility and superb decorative arts coupled with masterworks"".
John Russell of the Times said in 1981 that ""The Frick is loved for its unpushy ways, for the largesse of its hospitality and for the high quality of what it has to show."" In a review for the Christian Science Monitor the same year, Madeline Lee wrote that the museum was special because of its courtyard and reflecting pool; another reviewer for the same newspaper said ""The Frick is the only museum I know whose collection consists almost exclusively of great or nearly great art."" GQ magazine said that ""the most renowned—and probably best—combined house and art collection of a so-called 'robber baron' is that of Henry Clay Frick"". Bryan Miller of the Times wrote in 1987 that there were ""artistic gems in every room"", and Grace Glueck of the same paper called it ""the enclave of masterpieces"". A Los Angeles Times critic in 1990 said the Frick Collection ""represents the aristocratic aspirations of turn-of-the-century robber barons"". Another New York Times critic called the museum ""as frumpy and elegant as a dowager queen"", describing the quality of its collection and the Frick House. A Globe and Mail reviewer said the museum was extremely peaceful and was ""a more comfortable museum than most"" because it used to serve as a residence.","The Frick Collection is a renowned private art museum in New York City, known for its exceptional collection of paintings and decorative arts, located in the historic Frick mansion."
"A 2000 poll by Travel Holiday magazine ranked the Frick Collection as the third-best art museum in the U.S. Upon the museum's 75th anniversary in 2010, a Wall Street Journal critic wrote that, although the museum lacked major shows and had not undergone a high-profile renovation, it ""quietly attracts a steady stream of about 300,000 visitors each year who come to see one of the most extraordinary assemblages of fine and decorative arts in the world"". A reviewer for the Condé Nast Traveler wrote that the museum was ""exactly the right scale, everything in the collection is worth seeing, and can be viewed in an hour or less"", while a New Yorker writer said that ""you feel more than welcomed—you feel invited, like a family friend"" at the Frick House. A critic for the Daily Telegraph wrote in 2014 that the Frick was ""the best small museum in New York, perfect if you don't fancy dealing with a crush of people at MoMA or the Met"".
When the museum was temporarily relocated to 945 Madison Avenue, one critic wrote that the temporary building was ""an exercise in contrasts"" with the Frick House's decorations and that ""the vibe here is serious and meditative"". Another critic wrote for Vogue that the Frick Madison was a ""shock to the senses in every way"" but that ""the collection comes directly to the fore"" amid that building's bare walls. Writers for the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal similarly said that the spartan setting helped highlight the collection itself.","The Frick Collection is a renowned art museum known for its exceptional collection of fine and decorative arts, attracting millions of visitors annually."
"Fort Pitt was a fort in what is now the city of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The fort was built in 1758 during the French and Indian War, next to the site of Fort Duquesne. The French built Fort Duquesne at the beginning of that war, and it became a focal point due to its strategic river location. The Braddock expedition, a 1755 attempt to take Fort Duquesne, met with a bloody repulse at the Monongahela River. The French garrison viciously mauled an attacking British regiment in September 1758, but abandoned and destroyed the fort at the approach of General John Forbes's expedition in November.
The Forbes expedition was successful where the Braddock expedition had failed because of the Treaty of Easton, in which area American Indians agreed to abandon their alliance with the French. American Indians— primarily Delawares and Shawnees— made this agreement with the understanding that the British military would leave the area after the war. The Indians wanted a trading post on the spot, but they did not want a British army garrison. The British, however, built a new fort on the site and named it Fort Pitt, after William Pitt the Elder. 

As a result, in 1763 local Delawares and Shawnees took part in Pontiac's Rebellion, an effort to drive the British out of their territory. The Indians' siege of Fort Pitt began on June 22, 1763, but the fort was too strong to be taken by force. In negotiations during the siege, the commander of Fort Pitt gave two Delaware emissaries blankets that had been exposed to smallpox, in hopes of infecting the surrounding Indians and ending the siege. The effectiveness of this attempt is unclear. Outbreaks of smallpox had plagued Native Americans for years before, during and after the Fort Pitt attempt, killing much of the Native American population. On August 1, 1763, most of the Indians broke off the siege in order to intercept an approaching force under Colonel Henry Bouquet, resulting in the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 10.
After Pontiac's War, Fort Pitt was no longer necessary to the British Crown and was abandoned to the locals in 1772. At that time, the Pittsburgh area was claimed by both Virginia and Pennsylvania, and a power struggle for the region commenced. Virginians took control of Fort Pitt, and for a brief while in the 1770s it was called Fort Dunmore, in honour of Virginia's Governor Lord Dunmore. The fort served as a staging ground in Dunmore's War of 1774.
During the American Revolutionary War, Fort Pitt served as a headquarters for the western theatre of the war. Fort Pitt fell into disrepair once again in the years following the Revolution. It was abandoned in 1792 when Fort Fayette was built to replace it. Residents of the growing Pittsburgh used the remnants of the fort to build permanent housing for themselves.
A small brick building called the Blockhouse—actually a type of outbuilding known as a redoubt—remains in Point State Park, the only intact remnant of Fort Pitt. It was erected in 1764 and is believed to be the oldest building, not only in Pittsburgh but in western Pennsylvania. Used for many years as a home, the blockhouse was purchased and has been preserved for many years by the Daughters of the American Revolution, who make it open to the public. Part of the foundations of Fort Pitt have been excavated and some of the fort has been rebuilt, though, giving visitors to Point State Park a sense of the size of the fort. In this rebuilt section the Monongahela Bastion houses the Fort Pitt Museum.
Fort Pitt Foundry was an important armaments manufacturing centre for the Federal government during the Civil War, under the charge of William Metcalf.",Fort Pitt was a fort built during the French and Indian War and later renamed Fort Pitt after William Pitt the Elder. It played a significant role in the American Revolutionary War and was eventually abandoned in 1792.
"Michael DeBerardinis, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, announced a $25 million plan to renovate Point State Park and parts of the Fort Pitt Museum on October 11, 2006. The plans call for improving the green spaces within the park, expanding recreational opportunities, preserving historical installations and updating outdated amenities. The project was originally scheduled to be complete within four years, with the majority of the work to be completed in time for Pittsburgh's 250th-anniversary celebration in 2008.
Sections of the park have fallen into disuse since it was established in 1974. The homeless have used the trenches surrounding the foundations of the remains of Fort Pitt as a temporary shelter for years. Graffiti on the structures of the park has become a major problem. Sections of the park are littered with fence posts, cut logs, plastic drums, and rolled up snow drift fencing. The walkways have become cracked and are beginning to fall apart. The goal of the restoration project is to re-establish the park as a recreational destination.
Plans for improving the park are well underway.  They include installing new pumps and pipes in the fountain, establishing a seating area around the fountain and a wading area for children, restoring the river walk with steps that lead into the river, building kiosks for information and concessions, renovating the restrooms, renovating the water taxi landings and surrounding docks, and installing wireless internet access hubs.  Currently (April 2011) the waterfront area is closed to pedestrians as the stone walkways and wharf area are being resurfaced.  They are to be reopened during the summer, 2011.
These plans were not put into place without some controversy. On January 25, 2007, thirteen members of two different locals labour unions were arrested for blocking access by contractors to the work sites at the remnants of Fort Pitt. The labour union protested the use of four non-labour workers by the contractor responsible for completing the work at Point State Park. [1]
On August 14, 2009, the state closed the museum and three other PHMC museums indefinitely due to a lack of funding as part of an ongoing budget crisis. Management of the museum is supposed to be taken over by Senator John Heinz Regional History Center once the state budget is passed. The Senator John Heinz History Center reopened the Fort Pitt Museum on Saturday, April 17, 2010. The History Center's museum system also includes a Smithsonian-affiliated, seven-story museum in Pittsburgh's Strip District;  Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America located in Avella, Pa.; and the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, a two-floor museum-within-a-museum at the History Center.
Currently, the Fort Pitt Museum is open to visitation seven days a week from 10am - 5pm.  The museum is closed only on major holidays (Christmas, New Years, Thanksgiving and Easter)","A $25 million renovation plan for Point State Park and Fort Pitt Museum in Pittsburgh, including improvements to green spaces, recreational opportunities, and historical preservation."
"The inaugural Picklesburgh festival took place on July 17 and 18, 2015, on the Rachel Carson Bridge in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Organized by the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, a non-profit organization, and sponsored primarily by Pittsburgh-based Heinz (now Kraft Heinz), the festival was inspired by Pittsburgh's rich history of pickling. Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership president Jeremy Waldrup explained that pickles ""speak to the ethnic, cultural history of Pittsburgh, as a melting pot for Eastern European ethnic communities"", although numerous countries of Western culture with significant diasporas in the United States, like Germany and Poland, also employ pickling in their national cuisines. According to Waldrup, the festival was also inspired by the growing farm-to-table movement and the trend of urban homesteading.
At Picklesburgh 2016, the second annual festival held at Rachel Carson Bridge, Heinz debuted their first new pickle flavors in over 50 years. The 2017 festival was held at the nearby Roberto Clemente Bridge, where it also took place in 2018 and 2019, gradually taking up more abutting street space each year. Having begun as a two-day festival in 2015, a three-day schedule was established in 2018, which was further expanded to four days in 2024. Picklesburgh was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it returned in August 2021 with additional safety precautions on the Andy Warhol Bridge.
In 2022, the festival returned to its original locale on the Rachel Carson Bridge, with food vendors along the neighboring 10th Street Bypass. Picklesburgh 2022 drew 90,000 attendees, leading organizers to periodically close the Rachel Carson Bridge to prevent overcrowding. Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership director Jack Dougherty remarked, ""At times, especially during our peak hours, it would get very crowded and just kind of become a little uncomfortable for everyone in attendance.""
In response, for its 2023 installment, the festival was relocated to a larger venue occupying three blocks of the Boulevard of the Allies between Stanwix Street and Smithfield Street, and along Market Street into PPG Place. Even with its larger location, Picklesburgh 2023 still saw enormous shoulder-to-shoulder crowds, with attendance more than doubling to 200,000 visitors. Amid mid-summer heat and huge crowds, 16 attendees were hospitalized due to heat exhaustion and other ailments.","The inaugural Picklesburgh festival, inspired by Pittsburgh's pickling history and farm-to-table movement, has grown into a three-day event attracting millions of attendees annually, despite occasional overcrowding and safety concerns."
"
Since its founding in 2015, every Picklesburgh festival has featured a pickle juice drinking competition as its headline event. In the competition, contestants race to drink a quart-sized jar of pickle juice without regurgitating, spilling, or leaving any juice in the jar. The winner is dubbed the ""Mayor of Picklesburgh"" and receives a belt and a $500 cash prize, as of 2023.
The 2023 champion and reigning ""Mayor of Picklesburgh"" is Pittsburgh native Dan Koba, who drank the jar of pickle juice in 7 seconds. The all-time record was set at Picklesburgh 2022, when Wisconsin-based TikTok content creator Jalen Franko won the competition by drinking the quart of juice in 4.5 seconds.

"The Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season. Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers ""Mean"" Joe Greene in 1969, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970, Jack Ham in 1971, Franco Harris in 1972, and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting five Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John Stallworth, Donnie Shell and Mike Webster. The Pittsburgh Steelers' 1974 draft was their best ever; no other team has ever drafted five future Hall of Famers in one year, and only very few (including the 1970 Steelers) have drafted two or more in one year.
The players drafted in the early 1970s formed the base of an NFL dynasty, making the playoffs in eight seasons and becoming the only team in NFL history to win four Super Bowls in six years, as well as the first to win more than two. They also enjoyed a regular-season streak of 49 consecutive wins (1971–1979) against teams that would finish with a losing record that year.
The Steelers suffered a rash of injuries in the 1980 season and missed the playoffs with a 9–7 record. The 1981 season was no better, with an 8–8 showing. The team was then hit with the retirements of all their key players from the Super Bowl years. ""Mean"" Joe Greene retired after the 1981 season, Lynn Swann and Jack Ham after 1982's playoff berth, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount after 1983's divisional championship, and Jack Lambert after 1984's AFC Championship Game appearance.
After those retirements, the franchise skidded to its first losing seasons since 1971. Though still competitive, the Steelers would not finish above .500 in 1985, 1986, and 1988. In 1987, the year of the players' strike, the Steelers finished with a record of 8–7, but missed the playoffs. In 1989, they would reach the second round of the playoffs on the strength of Merrill Hoge and Rod Woodson before narrowly missing the playoffs in each of the next two seasons, Noll's last seasons.
Noll's career record with Pittsburgh was 209–156–1.","The Pittsburgh Steelers' draft selections in the 1970s led to an NFL dynasty, winning four Super Bowls in six years."
"In 1992, Chuck Noll retired and was succeeded by Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Bill Cowher, a native of the Pittsburgh suburb of Crafton.

Cowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns. In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the AFC Championship Game three times and following the 1995 season an appearance in Super Bowl XXX on the strength of the ""Blitzburgh"" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts. Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XL over the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks ten years later. With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990. He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8–8 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship.
Cowher's career record with Pittsburgh was 149–90–1 in the regular season and 161–99–1 overall, including playoff games.","Bill Cowher led the Pittsburgh Steelers to multiple Super Bowl appearances and championships, including their first-ever Super Bowl victory in 2005."
"On January 7, 2007, Cowher resigned from coaching the Steelers, citing a need to spend more time with his family. He did not use the term ""retire"", leaving open a possible return to the NFL as coach of another team. A three-man committee consisting of Art Rooney II, Dan Rooney, and Kevin Colbert was set up to conduct interviews for the head coaching vacancy. On January 22, 2007, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin was announced as Cowher's successor as head coach. Tomlin is the first African-American to be named head coach of the team in its 75-year history. In his first season, he led the Steelers to a 10–6 record and AFC North title. The team fell to the Jacksonville Jaguars 31–29 in the Wild Card Round to end the season. The following year, he led the Steelers to a 12–4 mark and a division title. With wins over the San Diego Chargers in the Divisional Round and the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship, Tomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement. On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27–23 against the Arizona Cardinals. At age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl (Tony Dungy was the first). In their title defense, the Steelers went 9–7 and missed the postseason in the 2009 season. In the 2010 season, Tomlin led the team to a 12–4 record and an AFC North title. The team defeated the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round and the New York Jets in the AFC Championship. Tomlin became the only coach to reach the Super Bowl twice before the age of 40 as he took the team to Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011. However, the Steelers were defeated by the Green Bay Packers, 31–25.
In the 2011 season, the Steelers made the postseason with a 12–4 record. They lost in overtime to the Denver Broncos in the Wild Card Round. The Steelers recorded their 400th victory in Week 8 of the 2012 season after defeating the Washington Redskins. Overall, the Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason in 2012. In the 2013 season, the Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason. In the 2014 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11–5 record. They lost 30–17 to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round. The Steelers finished with a 10–6 record and made the playoffs in the 2015 season. They defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the Wild Card Round and lost to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round. In the 2016 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 11–5 record. They defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Round and the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round before falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. In the 2017 season, the Steelers won the AFC North with a 13–3 mark. Their postseason was short lived with a 45–42 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Despite a 9–6–1 record in the 2018 season, the Steelers missed the playoffs. The Steelers went 8–8 and missed the postseason in the 2019 season. The 2020 season saw the Steelers have franchise-best 11–0 start. However, the team faded at the end of the season to finish 12–4. The team lost in the Wild Card Round to the Cleveland Browns 48–37. The 2021 season saw the team go 9–7–1 and make the postseason. The Steelers lost 42–21 to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card Round. Longtime quarterback Ben Roethlisberger retired following the 2021 season.
Through the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin's record is 162–94–2 (.632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013–17 seasons were noted for record performances from the ""Killer B's"". This trio consisted of Antonio Brown, Ben Roethlisberger and Le'Veon Bell. Occasionally, the ""Killer B's"" has also included kicker Chris Boswell due to his ability to hit game-winning field goals.
Prior to the 2022 season, the team drafted Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett with their first round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. Pickett started 12 games as the Steelers went 9–8 and missed the postseason in the 2022 season. In the 2023 season, the team finished 10–7 and third in the AFC North. They made the playoffs and were defeated by the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round 31–17. Prior to the 2024 season, the Steelers traded Pickett to the Philadelphia Eagles. The team traded for Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears and signed Russell Wilson, who was released from the Denver Broncos.",Mike Tomlin became the first African-American head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2007 and led the team to multiple Super Bowl victories.
"Since the NFL merger in 1970, the Pittsburgh Steelers have compiled a regular-season record of 444–282–2 (.635) and an overall record of 480–305–2 (.635) including the playoffs, reached the playoffs 30 times, won their division 22 times, played in 16 AFC championship games, and won six of eight Super Bowls. They are also the only NFL team not to have a season with 12 or more losses since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978.","The Pittsburgh Steelers have an impressive record of 444-282-2 (.635) in the NFL, including 30 playoff appearances, 22 division titles, and 6 Super Bowl victories."
"Since 2008, the Rooney family has brought in several investors for the team while retaining control of the team itself. This came about so that the team could comply with NFL ownership regulations. Dan Rooney, and his son, Art Rooney II, president of the franchise, wanted to stay involved with the franchise, while two of the brothers – Timothy and Patrick – wanted to further pursue racetracks that they own in Florida and New York. Since 2006, many of the racetracks have added video slot machines, causing them to violate ""NFL policy that prohibits involvement with racetrack and gambling interests"".
Upon Dan Rooney's death in 2017, he and Art Rooney II retained control of the team with the league-minimum 30%, the following made up the other investors at the time:

Several other members of the Rooney family, including Art Rooney Jr., John Rooney, and the McGinley family, who are cousins to the Rooneys.
The Robert A. Paul family of Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, which is primarily involved with Pittsburgh-based Ampco Pittsburgh Corporation as well as Morton's Restaurant Group, Urban Active Fitness, Meyer Products and Harley Marine Services. Additionally, family members serve on numerous boards, including Cornell University, UPMC, University of Pittsburgh, the American Red Cross, Harvard Medical School and the Loomis Chaffee School.
Former Steelers wide receiver John Stallworth, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
Legendary Pictures president and CEO Thomas Tull.
GTCR chairman Bruce V. Rauner. 
The Peter Varischetti family of Brockway, which owns several nursing homes and a commercial real estate business.
Paul Evanson, chairman, president, and CEO of Allegheny Energy.
Russ and Scott Swank of Lower Burrell.
Three minority investors in the Steelers have since became majority owners of other NFL teams:

Pilot Flying J CEO Jimmy Haslam purchased the Cleveland Browns in 2012.
Hedge fund manager David Tepper purchased the Carolina Panthers in 2018.
Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils owner Josh Harris purchased the Washington Commanders in 2023. Investment partner David Blitzer was also a part of the Harris group.","The Rooney family retained control of the Pittsburgh Steelers through various investors, including cousins, family members serving on boards, and minority investors who later became majority owners of other NFL teams."
"Through the end of the 2023 season, the Steelers have an all-time record of 707–606–22, including playoffs. In recent seasons the Steelers have generally performed well, qualifying for the playoffs six times in the past ten seasons, while winning their division four times.
In the NFL's ""modern era"" (since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970) the Steelers have posted the best record in the league. The franchise has won the most regular-season games, the most playoff games (33 playoff wins; the Dallas Cowboys are second with 32), won the most divisional titles (20), has played in the most conference championship games (15), hosted the most conference championship games (11), and is tied with the Dallas Cowboys, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl appearances (8). The Steelers have the best winning percentage (including every expansion team), earned the most All-Pro nominations, and have accumulated the most Super Bowl wins (6) since the modern game started in 1970. In 2017, they became the first team to reach 450 victories in the regular season since the 1970 merger. The Steelers are 36–26 (.580) in the postseason, with all but one (the 1947 playoff) having been played since the merger.","The Pittsburgh Steelers have an all-time record of 707–606–22, including playoffs, and have won the most regular-season games, playoff games, divisional titles, conference championship games, and Super Bowl appearances since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970."
"The franchise, along with the Rooney family have for generations been strong advocates for equality of opportunity for both minorities and women. Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957, with Lowell Perry), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973, with Joe Gilliam), the first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975, with Franco Harris), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984, with Tony Dungy), the first owner to push for passage of an ""equal opportunity"" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer (Ariko Iso on July 24, 2002).","The document highlights the significant contributions of the Rooney family and the Pittsburgh Steelers franchise to promoting equality and diversity in sports, including hiring African-American coaches, quarterbacks, MVPs, coordinators, and athletic trainers."
"The Steelers were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1943 and were briefly in the Western Division in 1944, before returning to the Eastern Division until 1949. The team was then in the American Conference from 1950 to 1952, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Century Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Steelers were placed in the AFC Central until 2001 when they were realigned into the AFC North Division.",The Steelers have been in various divisions and conferences since their formation in 1933.
"The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the ""Steagles""; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used ""Vegas Gold"", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers ""gold"" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag.
The Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the ""Steelmark"", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland-based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word ""Steelers"" surrounded by three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). The original meanings behind the astroids were, ""Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world."" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel. While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word ""Steel"", the team was given permission to add ""ers"" in 1963 after a petition to AISI.
The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently. A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more.
The Steelers, along with the New York Giants, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets.
The current uniform designs were introduced in 1968. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (Futura Condensed) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey.
The 2007–2011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007. They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963–1964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only.
In 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal stripped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the ""bumblebee jerseys"" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.
Also in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black Color Rush uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants.
In 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn from 1968 to 1997, coinciding with the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed.
In 1979, the team owners were approached by then-Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers. Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors.","The Steelers' black and gold colors are the team's primary colors, shared by other major professional teams in Pittsburgh, and have been since the club's inception. The team's logo, based on the Steelmark, has evolved over time, reflecting the steel-making process and the team's history."
"The Steelers and Cleveland Browns have been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9–31 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66–27–1 (including 42–6 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75–58–1; The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009. Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970–85) and 15 (2004–present) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following Marty Schottenheimer for a brief tenure as Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator, and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met three times in the postseason (1994, 2002, and 2021) with the Steelers winning the first two meetings, but losing the most recent in 2021.","The Steelers and Cleveland Browns have a long-standing rivalry dating back to 1950, with the Steelers leading the series 75-58-1 since 1970."
"Pittsburgh's rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens has had several memorable match-ups and has escalated into a fierce divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home stadiums. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium in 1998, 20–13, and three years later the Ravens handed the Steelers their first-ever loss at Heinz Field, 13–10. Later that season (2001) Pittsburgh won a divisional playoff game 27–10 against Baltimore, who was the defending Super Bowl champion. During their NFL championship season in 2000, the Ravens defeated the Steelers in Pittsburgh, 16–0, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9–6, in Baltimore (the Ravens' final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 32–24. The teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3–1 record.",Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens have had numerous memorable matchups and a fierce divisional rivalry since 1998.
"The Steelers' rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals dates from the 1970 season, when the AFL–NFL merger was completed. In 1976, the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7–3 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the 2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game, in which the Steelers, en route to a Super Bowl title, won a 31–17 come-from-behind victory after Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen contacted Palmer's knee during a passing play. The Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit. The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the 2005 season 38–31, and wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh used a Terrible Towel to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished 2005 and 2006 with identical records (11–5 and 8–8 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in 2005 and taking them out of contention in 2006. The rivalry has become more intense again since the 2015 season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict, often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18–16 Steelers comeback victory. The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63–35. The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times.","The Steelers and Bengals have a long-standing rivalry dating back to the 1970s, intensified by incidents like the 2005 playoff game and recent instances involving linebacker Vontaze Burfict."
"The New England Patriots emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28–3 while the Steelers won 7–6 in 1997; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30–14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15–1 regular season.
The Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period (1998–2007) before the Steelers broke through with a 33–10 victory at Foxborough in 2008, after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in 2013 then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55–31. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28–21) and 2016's regular season (27–16), and then won 36–17 in the 2016 AFC Championship Game. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end Jesse James was controversially called back. Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17–10 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh.
In the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135–75, with the Patriots maintaining a 4–1 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the Los Angeles Chargers (2–1), the Jacksonville Jaguars (2–0), and the Broncos (5–3). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15–13 against the Patriots. In the Bill Belichick era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12–4 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33–3 on Sunday Night Football.","The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers have had a long-standing rivalry dating back to the 1990s, with the Patriots emerging as a dominant force in the AFC Championship Game in 2001. The Steelers have won three of the last four meetings, including a 33-10 victory in 2008."
"Pittsburgh also has a rivalry with the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans franchise. The Oilers were aligned into the AFC Central with the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34–31 playoff showdown in 2002); the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997–2001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series. The Steelers have won 47 of 79 career meetings following their 27–24 win at Nissan Stadium in 2020.","Pittsburgh's rivalry with the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans franchise has been intense, with the Steelers dominating the rivalry during the Houston era but losing ground since the franchise moved to Tennessee."
"The Denver Broncos in 2011 broke a tie with the Oakland Raiders for the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in 2015 (the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland's six). The Steelers' rivalry with the Broncos dates from 1970, but the first notable contest came in 1973, when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at Three Rivers Stadium, 23–13. The following year, they met in the NFL's first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35–35 tie. Denver's first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round; the Broncos won 34–21. The following year, the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver 33–10 in the divisional round. Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in Mile High Stadium; the Steelers pulled the upset 24–17. They nearly pulled the upset again 5 years later in Denver, but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff, 24–23.
In 1997, the two teams met in Pittsburgh for the AFC Championship Game, where Denver squeaked out at 24–21 win. Eight years later, the Steelers advanced to Super Bowl XL by beating Denver 34–17 in Colorado. In 2011, after appearing in Super Bowl XLV, the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as AFC Champions dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the Tim Tebow-led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the ""316 game"". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31–19 in Peyton Manning's debut as Broncos quarterback. The two clubs met twice in 2015, as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; through the 2021 season, Denver leads the series 20–13–1, including 5–3 in the playoffs. Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row. In their last matchup, the Steelers beat the Broncos on October 10, 2021, in Pittsburgh by the score of 27–19.","The document provides a chronological overview of the Steelers' rivalry with the Denver Broncos, detailing key matchups, playoff appearances, and significant victories and losses over several decades."
"The Steelers' rivalry with the Raiders was one of the most heated battles of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers' first playoff victory in franchise history came against the Raiders, which occurred on December 23, 1972, in a 13–7 victory over the Raiders; the victory occurred when Terry Bradshaw threw a pass intended for John Fuqua that was deflected into the hands of Franco Harris, who scooped the ball from nearly hitting the ground and carried the ball in for a touchdown, which was later referred to as the Immaculate Reception, while attracting controversy from Raiders players and coaches, who alleged that the ball had bounced off Fuqua, which would have made it an illegal play per the rules of the time. The victory sent Pittsburgh to their first ever AFC Championship Game. The following year, the two teams met in the Divisional Round again, and the Raiders responded with a 33–14 victory to advance to the AFC title game. However, Pittsburgh fired back with two straight AFC Championship victories over the Raiders in 1974 (24–13) and 1975 (16–10) to reach the Super Bowl. Oakland responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the 1976 AFC Championship game 24–7 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before Chuck Noll referred to Oakland's George Atkinson as part of the NFL's ""criminal element"" after his alleged cheap-shot on Lynn Swann during a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38–10 in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw who did not play due to injury.
While the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to Oakland's decline after 2002), the teams have had notable games against each other including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the 2000 season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the 2006 NFL season (20–13), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth. In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened; the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB Bruce Gradkowski's third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27–24 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at Pittsburgh in 2010, where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35–3, and ended their 3-game winning streak; the game was further notable for a punch thrown by Richard Seymour of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in 2012 and erased a 31–21 gap to win 34–31. The two clubs met again in 2013 and the Raiders won again, 21–18. In 2015, the Steelers defeated the Raiders 38–35 at Heinz Field.
In their most recent matchups, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 24–21 on December 9, 2018, in Oakland, which, ironically, would cost Pittsburgh another playoff berth. The Raiders won at Pittsburgh September 19, 2021, 26–17, then fell on Christmas Eve 2022 at Pittsburgh 13–10 on a last-minute touchdown by rookie Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett. A lifeless performance in a 23–18 loss at Vegas September 23, 2023, contributed to the later firing of Raiders coach Josh McDaniels and GM Dave Ziegler. As of the 2023 season, the Raiders lead the all-time series 17–15.","The Steelers-Raiders rivalry was intense in the 1970s and early 1980s, with the Steelers winning multiple playoff games against the Raiders. The rivalry has since diminished, but the teams have had notable games against each other."
"The Steelers once took part in a historic rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys started with the Cowboys' first game as a franchise in 1960 (against the Steelers) at the Cotton Bowl with the Steelers coming away with a 35–28 victory. These teams hold a record for the most times (three) that two teams have met in a Super Bowl. The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl Super Bowl X 21–17 and Super Bowl XIII 35–31. The Cowboys never won a regular-season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers). Between the Cowboys and Steelers, Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating, which as of 2021 numbered 25 – 16 players and nine coaches/front office, including Ernie Stautner, defensive coordinator for the Cowboys who was a HoF defensive tackle for the Steelers. The teams featured an all-star matchup at quarterback between the Steelers' Terry Bradshaw and the Cowboys' Roger Staubach, both of whom are in the Hall of Fame. In 1977, Staubach and the Cowboys won Super Bowl XII, their second and last loss of their season being inflicted by Bradshaw and the Steelers, 28–13 at Three Rivers Stadium in November. In 1979, Staubach's final season, the two defending conference champs met again at Three Rivers, the Steelers winning 14–3 en route to winning their fourth Super Bowl title. The Steelers won six of eight meetings during the 1970s and 80s, before the Cowboys won all four meetings during the 1990s, including the teams' record third Super Bowl meeting in 1996, as this time the heavily favored Cowboys beat the Steelers 27–17. Dallas cornerback Larry Brown intercepted Pittsburgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell twice and was named the game's MVP. The teams' first two meetings of the 21st century (2004 and 2008) were won by the Steelers, including a come from behind victory on December 7, 2008, in Pittsburgh, when the Steelers drove the length of the field to tie the game 13–13, then cornerback Deshea Townsend returned an intercepted pass from Tony Romo for the game's final score, Steelers 20, Cowboys 13. The Cowboys won on December 16, 2012, at Cowboys Stadium by a 27–24 margin in overtime and won 35–30 at Heinz Field on November 13, 2016. The all-time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys, 17–16. The Pittsburgh/Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the 1977 film Black Sunday, parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X. Most recently, the Steelers beat the Cowboys by a 24–19 margin.","The Steelers and Dallas Cowboys have had a long-standing rivalry dating back to 1960, with the Cowboys winning the most Super Bowl matchups (three) and featuring many Hall of Fame players."
"The Philadelphia Eagles and Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35–13. The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 49–29–3.","The Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers have been rivals since 1933, with their last meeting in 2022."
"Prior to the 2007 season, the Steelers introduced Steely McBeam as their official mascot. As part of the 75th anniversary celebrations of the team, his name was selected from a pool of 70,000 suggestions submitted by fans of the team. Diane Roles of Middlesex Township, submitted the winning name which was ""meant to represent steel for Pittsburgh's industrial heritage, ""Mc"" for the Rooney family's Irish roots, and Beam for the steel beams produced in Pittsburgh, as well as for Jim Beam, her husband's favorite alcoholic beverage.""

Steely's autograph is known to be drawn with an oversized S, and the L is drawn to look like a beam of steel.","The Steelers introduced Steely McBeam as their mascot in 2007, named after a fan suggestion that represented Pittsburgh's industrial heritage, Irish roots, and Jim Beam."
"The Steelers have a tradition of having a large fanbase, which has spread from Pittsburgh. In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked the Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their ""unbelievable"" sellout streak of 299 consecutive games. The team gained a large fan base nationally based on its success in the 1970s, but many consider the collapse of the city's steel industry at the end of the 1970s dynasty into the 1980s (and the resulting diaspora) to be a large catalyst for the size of the fan base in other cities. The Steelers have sold out every home game since the 1972 season.
The Pittsburgh Steelers have numerous unofficial fan clubs in many cities throughout the country, that typically meet in bars or taverns on game days. This phenomenon is known to occur for other NFL teams as well, but ""Steeler bars"" are more visible than most, including representative establishments even in cities that field their own NFL teams.

The Terrible Towel has been described by the Associated Press as ""arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team"". Conceived of by broadcaster Myron Cope in 1975, the towel's rights have since been given to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis, which cares for over 900 people with intellectual disability and physical disabilities, including Cope's autistic son. Since 1996, proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise more than $2.5 million for the school.","The Steelers have a large fanbase due to their success in the 1970s and the collapse of the city's steel industry in the 1980s.

"The Steelers have no official fight song, but many fan versions of ""Here We Go Steelers"" and the ""Steelers Polka"" (the latter a parody of ""Pennsylvania Polka"") by ethnic singer Jimmy Pol, both originating in the 1970s, have been recorded. Since 1994, the song ""Here We Go"" by local singer Roger Wood has been popular among fans. Since 2002, the 1979 Styx song ""Renegade"" is played near the end of the third quarter or the start of the fourth quarter at the start of a defensive stand to rally the crowd, featuring a compilation of recent Steelers defensive highlights. Another song from hometown rapper Wiz Khalifa, ""Black and Yellow"", which is an ode to growing up in Pittsburgh, is also a standard part of the Steelers home game experience.",The Steelers have several unofficial fight songs and a popular compilation song played during games.

In 1958, though they started splitting their home games at Pitt Stadium three blocks away at the University of Pittsburgh. From 1964 to 1969, the Steelers played exclusively at the on-campus facility before moving with the Pirates to Three Rivers Stadium on the city's Northside.

In February 2022, after Heinz declined to sign a new deal after naming rights expired, the Steelers signed a deal with Acrisure and renamed the stadium to Acrisure Stadium.",The Steelers moved into Heinz Field in 2001 and later renamed it to Acrisure Stadium.
"The Steelers hold training camp east of the city at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe. The site is one of the most storied in the league with Peter King of SI.com describing it as: ""... I love the place. It's the perfect training-camp setting, looking out over the rolling hills of the Laurel Highlands in west-central Pennsylvania, an hour east of Pittsburgh.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the team had season scrimmages at South Park in the suburban south hills of Pittsburgh. During various seasons including the strike season of 1987, the Steelers used Point Stadium in nearby Johnstown for game week practices. During the 1950s St. Bonaventure University (where Art Rooney's brother Silas was serving as athletic director) and suburban Ligonier also served as a pre-season training camp sites.","The Rooney family has a long-standing relationship with Duquesne University, which has been used as a training site for the Steelers since the 1930s."
"The Steelers retired Stautner's #70 in 1964 before creating a 50-year tradition of not retiring numbers. The team retired Greene's #75 in 2014 and left the possibility open that they would retire other players' jersey numbers at later dates.

"Its predecessor was the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science, which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major planetarium in the United States, and was popular for several decades.  However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the Carnegie Institute (under the leadership of Robert Wilburn) stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the $40 million building, designed by local architect Tasso Katselas, which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger. The Henry Buhl Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991.

"Highmark SportsWorks (formerly UPMC SportsWorks) is one of the major, permanent exhibits of the Carnegie Science Center.  It is one of larger science and sports exhibitions in the world, with over 30 interactive experiences in which visitors can participate. The main idea of SportsWorks is ""to inspire learning and curiosity by uniting the experience of sports for every age level with the laws of science that controls sports."" SportsWorks features three themed areas:  Physics of Sports (exploring the science of balance, trajectory, center of gravity, momentum, etc.), LifeWorks (featuring information for keeping a healthy lifestyle), and Sports Challenge (demonstrating various physical activities present in many sports).

"The  exhibit  was initiated by Charles Bowdish  (1896–1988) of Brookville, Pennsylvania. Bowdish was a soldier during  World War I.  When doctors discovered a congenital heart problem, he was honorably discharged from service and sent home, where he began to build models of structures around Brookville, his hometown.  Every Christmas, in his home on Creek Street (the house has since been demolished), the buildings were assembled in a display, complete with Lionel trains running through it.  On Christmas Eve 1920, Charles hosted his brother's wedding and reception, and entertained the guests by running his train display.  One of the guests, Alfred Truman, asked if he could bring some friends over to see it—word quickly spread, and nearly 600 people showed up.
Because of this, Christmas Eve 1920 is considered to be the birth date of the exhibit.
Bowdish soon began setting up and exhibiting his railroad yearly at Christmas time in his house.  Each year there would be a different theme, such as White Christmas or Indian Summer. The railroad spanned the entire second floor, and no admission fee was ever charged.  Thousands of people saw it over the years, some coming from other countries. A combination of a flood nearly destroying his stored models, and his insurance company refusing to cover the crowds anymore, forced Charles to begin searching for a new home for his work.  He originally offered it to Brookville, but the town declined.
Eventually he offered it to the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science in Pittsburgh (renamed Buhl Science Center in the 1970s). The Buhl offered him space, and the exhibit opened there on December 1, 1954, and ran until December 31.  During the 31-day period, figures showed that 23,885 visitors viewed the layout. It was originally 14' X 14', and was called The Great Christmastown Railroad. It was renamed The Miniature Railroad & Village in 1957. The exhibit was an instant hit, and was and still is one of the major holiday attractions in Pittsburgh. The MRRV was in the basement, and the queue would at times extend out the front door and around the block, and the wait would be four hours long.
Eventually the dates it was open would be the first weekend of November to the last weekend of February. It was then torn down and stored until the next year because the space had to be used for the annual science fair.
On January 1, 1987, the Buhl officially became a part of the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. The Buhl staff had been wanting to expand the science center so they could bring in large travelling exhibits, and create more of their own. Joining the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh allowed them to have the resources to do it. Buhl closed on August 31, 1991, and Kamin Science Center opened on October 5, 1991.
A whole new building allowed the museum to dedicate a room just to the MRRV. The new and expanded Miniature Railroad & Village opened in the Fall of 1992.","Charles Bowdish's Christmas Eve 1920 display of miniature railroad and village models in his home in Brookville, Pennsylvania, later became the Miniature Railroad & Village attraction at the Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science in Pittsburgh, which was eventually moved to the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh."

The new display's philosophy was the historic and educational significance of Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas; this permitted the display to be considered a large, animated history book.  Scenes on the display depict how people worked, lived, and played during the years 1880–1930.  These years cover part of the American Industrial Revolution, the Victorian and Edwardian eras, the Gilded Age (as Mark Twain called it), World War I, the Roaring 20s, and the beginning of the Great Depression.  All of the models featured on the display are handcrafted by staff, both paid and volunteers, and replicate real structures from around Western Pennsylvania.  The display boasts the largest steel mill ever replicated in O scale: the Sharon Steel Mill from Farrell, PA, which was constructed from the mill's actual blueprints.
Expert advisors were contracted to make the new display as lifelike as possible. For example, a Harvard professor designed the lighting system to resemble the movement of the Sun and actual daylight. A sophisticated computer system controls the layout.  Opto 22, a company which supplies NASA and Disney World with control modules, provided the system.
Every year, two months before Thanksgiving, the display closes down for maintenance.  During this shutdown period, new models are installed, and sometimes new animations are installed, which were constructed earlier in the year, for exhibition on the display. Occasionally old models are installed as well. Scenes on the display are updated, and the layout is given a careful and thorough cleaning. The exhibit reopens the day after Thanksgiving.","The new display features five independent loops with Lionel trains and a Bowser trolley, recreating life in Pittsburgh and its surrounding areas from 1880 to 1930, with handcrafted models and expertly crafted animations."
"Since 1999, Lionel has issued collectable boxcars and a caboose as part of the commemorative MRRV series.  Each year, the boxcar features a unique design, drawn up inhouse.  These limited edition cars are only available through the Kamin Science Center's XPLOR Store.  Additionally, Lionel produced a Sub car for the Kamin Science Center in 2002 as part of the LCCA Pittsburgh Convention.","Lionel has issued collectable boxcars and a caboose as part of the MRRV series since 1999, featuring unique designs drawn in-house and available exclusively through the Kamin Science Center's XPLOR Store."

"The Carnegie Technical Schools were founded in 1900 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by the Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, who wrote ""My heart is in the work"", when he donated the funds to create the institution. Carnegie's vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers, many of whom worked in his mills. Carnegie was inspired for the design of his school by the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, founded by industrialist Charles Pratt in 1887. In 1912, the institution changed its name to Carnegie Institute of Technology (CIT) and began offering four-year degrees. During this time, CIT consisted of four constituent schools: the School of Fine and Applied Arts, the School of Apprentices and Journeymen, the School of Science and Technology, and the Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women.
The Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was founded in 1913 by banker and industrialist brothers Andrew Mellon (who went on to become U.S. Treasury Secretary) and Richard B. Mellon in honor of their father, Thomas Mellon, patriarch of the Mellon family. The Institute began as a research organization that performed contract work for government and industry, initially as a department within the University of Pittsburgh. In 1927, the Mellon Institute was incorporated as an independent nonprofit. In 1937, the Mellon Institute's iconic building was completed on Fifth Avenue.
In 1967, with support from Paul Mellon, the Carnegie Institute of Technology merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon University. In 1973, Carnegie Mellon's coordinate women's college, the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, merged its academic programs with the rest of the university. The industrial research mission of the Mellon Institute survived the merger as the Carnegie Mellon Research Institute (CMRI) and continued doing work on contract to industry and government. In 2001, CMRI's programs were subsumed by other parts of the university or spun off into autonomous entities.","The Carnegie Technical Schools were founded by Andrew Carnegie in 1900 to provide vocational training for working-class Pittsburghers, while the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was established in 1913 by the Mellon brothers to conduct research for industry and government."
"Carnegie Mellon's 157.2 acre (63 ha) main campus is five miles (8 km) from downtown Pittsburgh, between Schenley Park and the neighborhoods of Squirrel Hill, Shadyside, and Oakland. Carnegie Mellon is bordered to the west by the campus of the University of Pittsburgh. Carnegie Mellon owns 81 buildings in the Oakland and Squirrel Hill neighborhoods of Pittsburgh.
For decades, the center of student life on campus was Skibo Hall, the university's student union. Built in the 1950s, Skibo Hall's design was typical of mid-century modern architecture but was poorly equipped to deal with advances in computer and internet connectivity. The original Skibo Hall was razed in the summer of 1994 and replaced by a new student union that is fully Wi-Fi enabled. Known as the University Center, the building was dedicated in 1996. In 2014, Carnegie Mellon re-dedicated the University Center as the Cohon University Center in recognition of the eighth president of the university, Jared Cohon.
A large grassy area known as ""The Cut"" forms the backbone of the campus, with a separate grassy area known as ""The Mall"" running perpendicular. The Cut was formed by filling in a ravine (hence the name) with soil from a nearby hill that was leveled to build the College of Fine Arts building.
The northwestern part of the campus (home to Hamburg Hall, Newell-Simon Hall, Smith Hall, and Gates Hillman Complex) was acquired from the United States Bureau of Mines in the 1980s.
Carnegie Mellon has been purchasing 100% renewable energy for its electricity since 2011.","Carnegie Mellon University's main campus is located five miles from downtown Pittsburgh, bordered by the University of Pittsburgh and other neighborhoods. The university has a history of updating its facilities, including the construction of the University Center in 1996 and the dedication of the Cohon University Center in 2014. The campus features a large grassy area called ""The Cut"" and a separate grassy area called ""The Mall."""
"The campus began to take shape in the Beaux-Arts architecture style of George Carnegie Palmer and Henry Hornbostel of Palmer & Hornbostel, winners of the 1904 competition to design the original institution and later the founder of the Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture.
There was little change to the campus between the first and second World War. A 1938 master plan by Githens and Keally suggested acquisition of new land along Forbes Avenue, but the plan was not fully implemented. The period starting with the construction of the Hall of the Arts building (former home of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration) in 1952 and ending with Wean Hall in 1971 saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon University. New facilities were needed to respond to the university's growing national reputation in artificial intelligence, business, robotics and the arts. In addition, an expanding student population demanded improved facilities for student life, athletics and libraries. The campus finally expanded to Forbes Avenue from its original land along Schenley Park.

The buildings of this era reflected contemporary architectural styles. The International Style, with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, had been in vogue in European settings since the 1930s. It came late to the Carnegie Mellon campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among American universities to abandon historical styles. By the 1960s, the International Style was adopted to accomplish needed expansion quickly and affordably with the swelling of student ranks in the aftermath of the GI Bill in 1944. Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement, but not in its form or materials.
During the 1970s and 1980s, the tenure of president Richard Cyert (1972–1990) witnessed a period of growth and development. The research budget grew from roughly $12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than $110 million in the late 1980s. Researchers in new fields like robotics and software engineering helped the university to build its reputation. One example was the introduction of the ""Andrew"" computing network in the mid-1980s. This project linking all computers and workstations on campus set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a technology leader in education and research. On April 24, 1985, cmu.edu, Carnegie Mellon's Internet domain, became one of the first six .edu domain names.","The document describes the evolution of the Carnegie Mellon campus from its Beaux-Arts architecture style to the adoption of International Style modern architecture in the 1960s and 1970s, reflecting changes in the university's focus on artificial intelligence, business, robotics, and the arts."
"In the 1990s and into the 2000s, Carnegie Mellon solidified its status among American universities, consistently ranking in the top 25 in the national U.S. News & World Report rankings, and in the top 30 (ranking 28th in 2022) amongst universities worldwide. Carnegie Mellon is distinct in its interdisciplinary approach to research and education. Through the establishment of programs and centers outside the limitations of departments or colleges, the university has established leadership in fields such as computational finance, information systems, cognitive sciences, management, arts management, product design, behavioral economics, energy science and economics, human–computer interaction, entertainment technology, and decision science. Within the past two decades, the university has built a new university center (Cohon University Center), theater and drama building (Purnell Center for the Arts), business school building (Tepper School of Business), and several dormitories. Baker Hall was renovated in the early 2000s, and new chemistry labs were established in Doherty Hall soon after. Several computer science buildings, such as Newell-Simon Hall, also were established, renovated or renamed in the early 2000s.
In 2006, Carnegie Mellon Trustee Jill Gansman Kraus donated the 80-foot (24 m)-tall sculpture Walking to the Sky, which was placed on the lawn facing Forbes Avenue between the Cohon University Center and Warner Hall. The sculpture was controversial for its placement, the general lack of input from the campus community, and its (lack of) aesthetic appeal.

The Gates Hillman Complex opened for occupancy on August 7, 2009. It sits on a 5.6-acre (2.3 ha) site on the university's West Campus, surrounded by Cyert Hall, the Purnell Center for the Arts, Doherty Hall, Newell-Simon Hall, Smith Hall, Hamburg Hall, and the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center. It contains 318 offices as well as labs, computer clusters, lecture halls, classrooms and a 255-seat auditorium. The Gates Hillman Complex was made possible by a $20 million lead gift from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and an additional $10 million grant from the Henry L. Hillman Foundation. The Gates Hillman Complex and the Purnell Center for the Arts are connected by the Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge.

On April 15, 1997, Jared L. Cohon, former dean of the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies, was elected president by Carnegie Mellon's board of trustees. During Cohon's presidency, Carnegie Mellon continued its trajectory of innovation and growth. His strategic plan aimed to leverage the university's strengths to benefit society in the areas of biotechnology and life sciences, information and security technology, environmental science and practices, the fine arts and humanities, and business and public policy. In 2006, following negotiations between President Cohon and South Australian Premier Mike Rann, CMU opened a campus of the Heinz College in the historic Torrens Building in Adelaide, Australia. President Cohon's term ended on June 30, 2013, after which he returned to the faculty at Carnegie Mellon.On July 1, 2003, Carnegie Mellon launched ""Insp!re Innovation"", a $1 billion comprehensive fundraising campaign. Half of the campaign goal is intended for the endowment to provide long-lasting support for faculty, students and breakthrough innovations. The campaign brought in a total of $1.19 billion, with $578.5 million going toward Carnegie Mellon's endowment. It also enabled the university to establish 31 endowed professorships, 97 endowed fellowships and 250 endowed scholarships. On September 7, 2011, William S. Dietrich II, the former chairman of Dietrich Industries, Inc., a subsidiary of Worthington Industries, Inc., pledged a gift of $265 million, effective on October 6, 2011, upon his death. In response to this gift, Carnegie Mellon renamed the College of Humanities and Social Sciences as the Marianna Brown Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences after William Dietrich's mother. On April 23, 2012, New York's Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and New York University's President John Sexton announced an agreement between New York City, New York's MTA, and a consortium of academic institutions, and private technology companies that led to the creation in New York of a Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP). The Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) is an applied science research institute composed of a partnership of institutions from around the globe, led by New York University with a consortium of universities including Carnegie Mellon, the University of Warwick, the City University of New York, the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, and the University of Toronto.In September 2012, Carnegie Mellon announced the construction of the Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall on the Pittsburgh campus. The new building is situated between Hamerschlag Hall, Roberts Hall, and Wean Hall and houses the university-wide Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation, the Bertucci Nanotechnology Lab, the Engineering Research Accelerator (formerly known as the Institute for Complex Engineered Systems), the Disruptive Health Technologies Institute, and the Department of Biomedical Engineering. Further, in November 2013, Carnegie Mellon announced a $67 million gift from David Tepper, who previously donated $56 million, to develop the Tepper Quadrangle on the north campus. The Tepper Quad includes a new Tepper School of Business facility across Forbes Avenue from a renovated and expanded Hamburg Hall (home to Heinz College) as well as other university-wide buildings and a welcome center which serves as a public gateway to the university.
In April 2015, Carnegie Mellon, in collaboration with Jones Lang LaSalle, announced the planning of a second office space structure, alongside the Robert Mehrabian Collaborative Innovation Center, an upscale and full-service hotel, and retail and dining development along Forbes Avenue. This complex will connect to the Tepper Quadrangle, the Heinz College, the Tata Consultancy Services Building, and the Gates-Hillman Center to create an innovation corridor on the university campus. The effort is intended to continue to attract major corporate partnerships to create opportunities for research, teaching, and employment with students and faculty.
On October 30, 2019, Carnegie Mellon publicly announced the launch of ""Make Possible: The Campaign for Carnegie Mellon University"", a campaign which seeks to raise $2 billion to advance the university's priorities, including campus development. Alongside the Tepper Quad and Hamburg Hall, Carnegie Mellon finished construction in 2020 on TCS Hall, an innovation center made possible with a $35 million gift from Tata Consultancy Services. Carnegie Mellon plans to collaborate with Emerald Cloud Lab to construct the world's first cloud lab in a university setting. The Carnegie Mellon University Cloud Lab is planned to be completed by the spring of 2023. Carnegie Mellon also plans to construct a new mechanical engineering building by fall 2023 (Scaife Hall), a new $105 million athletics center by fall 2024 (Highmark Center for Health, Wellness and Athletics), a $210 million Science Futures Building (R.K.

Schwartz also collaborated with drama student John-Michael Tebelak to expand his master's thesis project titled Godspell, created under the direction of Lawrence Carra, into a musical.
While enrolled at Carnegie Mellon, acting students Michael McKean and David Lander (class of 1969) created the characters ""Lenny and Squiggy"". The pair continued performing the characters in live comedy routines before joining the cast of the TV series Laverne & Shirley.
In 2008, Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch's ""Last Lecture"" became a pop culture phenomenon. Based on a lecture he gave in September 2007 – shortly after he learned his cancer had metastasized – his book quickly rose to the top of bestseller lists around the country. Named in Time magazine's Time 100 list of influential people, he died in July 2008 from pancreatic cancer.
In 2003, Carnegie Mellon established the Robot Hall of Fame in partnership with the Carnegie Science Center.
The 68th Tony Awards in 2014 announced Carnegie Mellon as its first educational partner in jointly awarding the ""Tony Honor for Excellence in Theatre Education"", which will ""honor kindergarten through high school (K-12) theatre educators"".","Carnegie Mellon University has been featured in numerous motion pictures, including Creepshow, Wonder Boys, and The Dark Knight Rises, among others."
"The Libraries of Carnegie Mellon include Hunt Library, the Roger Sorrells Engineering & Science Library, the Mellon Institute Library, the Posner Center, and the Qatar Library. Additionally, the Libraries' Million Book Project (2001–) sparked development of the Universal Digital Library. The university libraries host a number of full text special collections for public access, including the Andrew Carnegie Collection, Herbert A. Simon Collection, Allen Newell Collection, the H. John Heinz III Collection, the Pittsburgh Jewish Newspapers Project, and the Posner Memorial Collection. Carnegie Mellon students and faculty have access to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and some University of Pittsburgh libraries through consortial agreements with those institutions. The Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation (HIBD), dedicated as the Rachel McMasters Miller Hunt Botanical Library in 1961, has been a research division of CMU since its founding. The HIBD is an international bibliographical research and service in the fields of botany, horticulture, and the history of the plant sciences and has a significant research library and art holdings on the 5th floor of Hunt Library. The university's Software Engineering Institute also houses a research library.
Carnegie Mellon also manages the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps in Pittsburgh on which students throughout Pittsburgh's universities rely. Carnegie Mellon partners with the University of Pittsburgh to provide opportunities in Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps and Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps to its students.

"Carnegie Mellon neighbors the campus of the University of Pittsburgh, and in some cases, buildings of the two universities are intermingled. This helps to facilitate myriad academic and research collaborations between the two schools, including such projects as the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, the Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse, the Immune Modeling Center, the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, as well as the National Science Foundation-supported Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center. Further, the universities also offer multiple dual and joint degree programs such as the Medical Scientist Training Program, the Molecular Biophysics and Structural Biology Graduate Program, the Joint CMU-Pitt Ph.D. Program in Computational Biology, the Center for Neural Basis of Cognition, and the Law and Business Administration program. Some professors hold joint professorships between the two schools, and students at each university may take classes at the other (with appropriate approvals). CMU students and faculty also have access to the University of Pittsburgh library system, as well as the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. The two universities also co-host academic conferences, such as the 2012 Second Language Research Forum. In 2015, in conjunction with the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC, Carnegie Mellon became a partner of the Pittsburgh Health Data Alliance to leverage data analysis in health care.","Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh collaborate on numerous academic and research projects, offering dual and joint degree programs, and sharing resources like libraries and co-hosting academic conferences."
"Electron diffraction – Clinton Davisson won the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of electron diffraction in the famous Davisson–Germer experiment, which confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that particles of matter have a wave-like nature, which is a central tenet of quantum mechanics. In particular, their observation of diffraction allowed the first measurement of a wavelength for electrons.
Kevlar – Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965, the high-strength material was first used commercially in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires. Kevlar has many applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to bulletproof vests, all due to its high tensile strength-to-weight ratio; by this measure, it is five times stronger than steel.
Spectroscopy – John L. Hall won the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics with Theodor W. Hänsch and Roy J. Glauber for his pioneering work on laser-based precision spectroscopy and the optical frequency comb technique.
Neutron scattering – Clifford G. Shull was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics with Canadian Bertram Brockhouse for their pioneering work in neutron scattering, a technique that reveals where atoms are within a material like ricocheting bullets reveal where obstacles are in the dark.","Electron diffraction, Kevlar, spectroscopy, and neutron scattering are all Nobel Prize-winning discoveries in physics."
"Alice (software) – freeware (for non-commercial purposes) object-based educational programming language with an integrated development environment (IDE).
Andrew Project – distributed computing environment developed at Carnegie Mellon beginning in 1982. It was an ambitious project for its time and resulted in an unprecedentedly vast and accessible university computing infrastructure. The goal was to have connected 3M computer workstations.
Artificial intelligence – Several of the first AI software programs were created at Carnegie Mellon. These include the Logic Theorist, General Problem Solver, and Soar.
Autonomous vehicle – Navlab, the first autonomous car program was developed by Carnegie Mellon. Since then, H1ghlander and Sandstorm autonomous vehicles were developed at Carnegie Mellon and placed 3rd and 2nd in the DARPA Grand Challenge and Carnegie Mellon's Boss won the DARPA Grand Challenge (2007). The university continues to be a leader in autonomous research and development.
Dynamic random-access memory – In 1966, Robert H. Dennard invented the one-transistor memory cell consisting of a transistor and a capacitor for which a patent was issued in 1968. It became the basis for today's dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).
MEMS – Harvey C. Nathanson invented the first MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) device of the type now found in products ranging from iPhones to automobiles. Typical MEMS devices include the accelerometers found in smartphones and video game controllers, and the gyroscopes used in automobiles and wearables.
Xerox PARC – Founded in 1969 by George Pake and Jack Goldman, Xerox PARC has been at the heart of numerous revolutionary computer developments as laser printing, Ethernet, the modern personal computer, graphical user interface (GUI) and desktop paradigm, object-oriented programming, ubiquitous computing, electronic paper, amorphous silicon (a-Si) applications, the computer mouse, and advancing very-large-scale integration (VLSI) for semiconductors.
BLISS – system programming language developed at Carnegie Mellon by W. A. Wulf, D. B. Russell, and A. N. Habermann around 1970. It was perhaps the best known systems programming language until C made its debut in 1972.
Emoticon – The first true emoticon was developed at Carnegie Mellon by Scott Fahlman in 1982.
Hashtag – In a 2007 tweet, Chris Messina proposed vertical/associational grouping of messages, trends, and events on Twitter by the means of hashtags.
Java – class-based object oriented programming language that was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
Mach (kernel) – Richard Rashid and Avie Tevanian developed Mach at Carnegie Mellon from 1985 to 1994, ending with Mach 3.0, which is a true microkernel. Mach was developed as a replacement for the kernel in the BSD version of Unix, so no new operating system would have to be designed around it. Experimental research on Mach appears to have ended, although Mach and its derivatives exist within a number of commercial operating systems.  These include NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP, upon which macOS and iOS are based.
Wi-Fi network – Alex Hills created the first wi-fi network using a local area network (LAN) on the Carnegie Mellon campus in 1993.","A brief summary of the document is: The document covers various technological advancements and innovations at Carnegie Mellon University, including software development, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, memory technology, MEMS, Xerox PARC, BLISS, emoticons, hashtags, Java, Mach kernel, Wi-Fi networks, and more."

"In the early days of Carnegie Tech, there was a single bridge connecting Margaret Morrison Women's College with the Carnegie Institute of Technology. The bridge was a meeting place for students. In 1916, the bridge was taken down and the university filled in the area. The administration built a wooden fence as a new meeting place. The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fence. The administration was about to give up and tear it down, but that night a fraternity, as a prank, painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity party. Ever since, painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon tradition. The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus, in the area known as ""the Cut"". Students guard the fence 24 hours a day, and, as long as two vigils are maintained, no other student may ""take"" the fence. The fence can then be painted by the group that has it, but only between midnight and 6 am. Only hand brushes may be used; the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fine. The previous paint cannot be stripped, and each new painting adds a new layer. The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1' of surrounding paint, and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concrete. Today the fence is considered ""the world's most painted object"" by the Guinness Book of World Records.","The Carnegie Mellon University's ""Fence"" is a tradition where students paint it every night between midnight and 6 am, adding a new layer of paint each time."
"The Greek tradition at Carnegie Mellon began over 100 years ago with the founding of the first fraternity on campus, Theta Xi, in 1912. The Panhellenic sorority community was founded in 1945, by Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma. The Chi Omega chapter at Carnegie Mellon transformed into an independent sorority, Zeta Psi Sigma, and has since become Alpha Chi Omega. The Alpha Phi chapter was created in April 2013. There are two Asian American interest sororities – Alpha Kappa Delta Phi and Kappa Phi Lambda –, and one Asian American interest fraternity – Lambda Phi Epsilon.
Carnegie Mellon has eleven active fraternities: Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Phi Alpha, Alpha Sigma Phi, Delta Tau Delta, Lambda Phi Epsilon, Phi Delta Theta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Sigma Nu, and Sigma Phi Epsilon.
In addition to participating in campus traditions such as Buggy and Booth, the fraternities and sororities hold an annual fundraiser called Greek Sing, one of the largest Greek events of the year. Every two years, the organizations vote on a cause to support and raise money through ticket sales, ad sales, corporate sponsorships and donations. Each organization performs a 13-minute-long original show or a rendition of a popular show. In spring 2010, Greek Sing raised over $42,000 for St. Jude Children's Research.","Carnegie Mellon University's Greek system includes 11 fraternities and 2 sororities, with the annual Greek Sing fundraiser being one of the largest events of the year."
"In 2022, Welch House began to host the specialized Queer community, a living community suited to the needs of non-binary students by allowing students to ""live in the same room with any other student inclusive of sex assigned at birth, gender identity, gender expression, and/or sexual orientation"". Welch House consists of semi-suite singles and doubles. In addition, Stever House hosts an all-gender floor for students who would prefer a traditional double.
Spirit House is a residential community for upperclassmen designated for members of the SPIRIT student organization, a Black Student Union that serves as a haven for Black students within the Carnegie Mellon community and champions issues facing the Black community.","Welch House and Spirit House are two residential communities at Carnegie Mellon University, each catering to specific student needs and communities."
"On November 28, 1926, the 6–2 Carnegie Technical Institute football team shut out the undefeated Notre Dame Fighting Irish 19–0 at Forbes Field. Knute Rockne, the coach of the Irish at the time, was so confident that the Irish would defeat ""tiny Carnegie Tech"" that he decided to skip the game and travel to Chicago to watch the Army-Navy football game for scouting purposes. It was only later that he found out by telegram that the Irish had suffered their first loss of the season. ESPN compared the upset to the Appalachian State victory over the University of Michigan in 2007. The game was ranked the fourth-greatest upset in college football history by ESPN.
Since 2014, the Tartans play in the Presidents' Athletic Conference at the NCAA Division III level. The head coach of the football team is Ryan Larsen, who is currently the defending Presidents' Athletic Conference coach of the year.  Prior to losing in the Sweet 16 of this year's D3 playoffs, the Tartans held a 17-game win streak which was, at the time, the longest win streak across all NCAA divisions in football.","The 1926 Carnegie Tech football team upset the undefeated Notre Dame Fighting Irish 19-0, considered one of the greatest upsets in college football history."
"In recent years, the varsity track and cross country programs have seen outstanding success on the Division III national level.

"Prior to 1998, the JCC of Greater Pittsburgh had a small community gallery for nearly 25 years.  Under the auspices of Leslie A. Golomb Archived 2010-05-14 at the Wayback Machine, the gallery underwent a period of substantial growth, evolving into a museum and receiving accreditation from the Council of American Jewish Museums (CAJM).  Accreditation by CAJM requires strict adherence to standards regarding archives, catalogues, and curating, as well as educational programs and outreach.
Today, the AJM galleries are still located on the Pittsburgh JCC's Squirrel Hill campus.  While the AJM continues to emphasize the Pittsburgh community in its exhibitions and programming, its scope has grown as it collaborates with regional, national, and international artists and organizations.  Additionally, the AJM frequently explores Jewish themes such as contemporary iterations of rituals, but aims to reach the wider community though exhibits with broad appeal and programming that encourages interfaith discourse.","The Pittsburgh Jewish Museum (AJM) has evolved from a small community gallery to a museum accredited by the Council of American Jewish Museums, emphasizing the Pittsburgh community while collaborating with various artists and organizations and exploring Jewish themes through exhibits with broad appeal."

"Plans for the museum were announced in October 1989, about 2½ years after Warhol's death.  At the time of the announcement, works worth an estimated $80 million were donated to the newly announced museum by the AWFVA and the Dia Art Foundation. Thomas N. Armstrong III, who had been the director of the Whitney Museum of American Art from 1974 to 1990, was named the museum's first director in 1993. Matt Wrbican joined the staff of the museum before it opened, inventorying Warhol's belongings in New York, and has become the archivist and an expert on Warhol's work.
By 1993, the 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m2) industrial warehouse and its extensive renovations had cost about $12 million, and the AWFVA had donated more than 1,000 of Warhol's works worth over $55 million, a donation that grew to about 3,000 works.
On May 13–14, 1994, the museum attracted about 25,000 visitors to its opening weekend.  Armstrong, its founding director, resigned nine months after its opening; at the time of his resignation, the museum had had ""tense relations"" with the AWFVA and the Carnegie Institute, its financial backer, though The New York Times could find no one involved who would say whether that friction played a role in Armstrong's resignation.
On November 1, 1997, the AWFVA donated all Warhol film and video copyrights to the museum.
In 2013, it was announced that in Manhattan, New York City, in the Essex Crossing development on the Lower East Side, an annex to the main Pittsburgh museum was scheduled to open by 2017.
 However, the museum announced in March 2015 that it had dropped its plans to open the New York annex.
In October 2019, an audio tape of publicly unknown music by Lou Reed, based on Warhol's 1975 book, “The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again”, was reported to have been discovered in an archive at the museum in Pittsburgh.
In 2022, the museum announced a $60 million expansion deemed The 'Pop District' covering six blocks in Pittsburgh, PA. The expansion looks to build a music venue, a social media studio called Warhol Creative, and expand places for public art exhibits. The proposed site would be around 58,000 square feet (17,500 square meters), including a first-floor concert venue with standing room for up to 1,000 people, a second-floor mezzanine, and an events space that could hold up to 360 people on the fourth floor. The third floor would be used for offices and support spaces. The project is expected to take ten years and is funded primarily through local foundations.","The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was founded in 1994 and has undergone several expansions and renovations since its opening."
"The 2010 film She's Out of My League filmed a key scene at the museum during an evening event.  The film's subject was hosting the event.

"The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust was founded in 1984 by H. J. Heinz II with the principal aim of restoring downtown Pittsburgh as a vibrant cultural destination. Heinz and others, including William Rea and his son, U.S. Senator John Heinz, began with Pittsburgh's first renovated former movie palace, Heinz Hall, (which was built as the former Loew's Penn Theater).

The PCT's first major project was the restoration of the former Stanley Theater. The Stanley Theater was originally designed by the firm of Hoffman & Henon and opened on February 27, 1928. Under the PCT's management, this theater underwent a $43 million restoration and reopened in 1987 as the 2,800-seat Benedum Center for the Performing Arts. That year, the PCT and its partners presented an annual Broadway series in the Cultural District.
The Byham Theater was another theater venue restoration project. Built in 1903 as the Gayety Theater, it included a stage and Vaudeville house, and featured stars such as Ethel Barrymore, Gertrude Lawrence, and Helen Hayes. It was renamed The Fulton during the 1930s when it became a full-time movie theater. In 1990, the PCT bought and refurbished the theater. The Byham family of Pittsburgh made a major naming gift for a 1995 renovation; it has been known as the Byham Theater since that time.
In 1992, PCT opened Wood Street Galleries, its first visual arts project. PCT purchased and refurbished a former XXX movie theater in 1995, and re-opened the 194-seat theater as the Harris Theater, which screens independent, foreign, and classic films.
In 1999, the PCT's 650-seat O'Reilly Theater opened as the permanent home of the Pittsburgh Public Theater. That same year, the 23,000-square-foot (2,100 m2) Agnes R. Katz Plaza was unveiled. The theater features a 25-foot (7.6 m) bronze fountain designed by sculptor Louise Bourgeois and the work of landscape architect Dan Kiley. Artists Robert Wilson and Richard Gluckman were also selected by the PCT to create a series of public art projects in the Cultural District.
In 2000, PCT established Shared Services, a consortium including the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera, Pittsburgh Public Theater, Pittsburgh Opera, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and August Wilson Center for African American Culture.
Jack Heinz chose PCT's first President and CEO, Carol Brown. She managed the organization from 1986 until 2000. In 2001, J. Kevin McMahon was named President and CEO.

In 2002, the Pittsburgh Dance Council became a programming division of PCT. PCT opened Theater Square in 2003, a 330,000-square-foot (31,000 m2) complex including the 265-seat Cabaret at Theater Square, a parking garage, centralized box office, restaurant, and bar, and the Carolyn M.

"{'title': 'Damaged seat on the PRT 58 bus today', 'content': 'This is just my personal opinion and nobody has to agree with it, but the 58 is a dismal line that only comes through every hour, and if there were more funding to the bus system as a whole, the 58 may just be more accessible and less hard-to-sit-in. I took the 58 earlier today before I took this photo on the way back to my residence and the roof was leaking, getting water all over the floor and the seating. Feel free to judge me for being a little miffed that the 58 is only accessible every hour, but a lot of people rely on that bus line: students, parents, businessmen, nurses and such. These people rely on the 58 to go to work and school, including myself. The 61C runs every fifteen to thirty minutes due to how many buses are assigned to that line, so why can’t the 58 be as accessible as the 61C? If the city of Pittsburgh can afford to let UPMC go tax free as a nonprofit, then they can afford to make public transit into downtown accessible, especially since it costs five dollars and five cents for residents in the Homestead, Greenfield, and South Side areas to go into downtown and then come back. If there were more funding in the PRT, there would be more activity in the city and it would genuinely be safer. To add in my conclusion about the whole PRT funding issue, the bus drivers could totally use a raise, point blank period.', 'date': '2024-10-01 00:04:30'}","The 58 bus line is described as a poorly maintained and infrequently used service, with concerns about its accessibility and funding."

We\'re pretty middle class people so we wouldn\'t be staying in luxury, but I\'m also OK with it costing a few bucks since it\'s a big deal birthday and trip for her.

I\'m picturing muddy snow piled up everywhere and things aren\'t as lively as usual because everyone is sick of winter. Would it make more sense to wait till March or April? I don\'t mind being a bit cold, but I\'m more wondering if the city feels sort of ""shut down"" at this time of year.\n\n2. Where to stay - we could do a hotel or air bnb. We\'d be staying 3 nights, so cost wise either would probably be fine. I\'m sure we\'d uber to most places, but it would be really cool to stay somewhere that has fun stuff that is walkable. Are there areas we should avoid, like in every city, as far as where to stay?\n\n3. What to do - I would imagine that there is a day or two of Mac Miller stuff to see, but I\'d also like to check out some of the other things in the city. I know I can google the big attractions, but I\'m just curious what locals think is overhyped or overlooked. She is a vegetarian and I like eating all types of meat. We won\'t be looking for fine dining or anything, but I\'d like to hit up anything that is known to be really good in Pittsburg (regional food). I was looking at flights and we would be coming on a Thursday night and returning on a Sunday. Is there anything in particular that happens every weekend there?

So I wanted to hear from the agency directly.\n\nAs of this time signals are being installed downtown for early activation. The signals will be installed and activated on the rest of the route within a few months of the completion of construction.\n\n* On project delays \nThe main reason the project timeline is delayed (now by two years) is because the federal funding process cannot be paralleled with local funding. PRT found the process for city approvals to be the main bottleneck. My wife asked if there were any constructive lessons to learn here. PRT has hired someone full time to liaise with the city and get these approvals moving faster. They believe they are on track and do not anticipate further delays\n\n* On offboard fare\nPRT said the agency is committed to all-door boarding, but is not final on the methodology. They did say they *didn\'t* want an approach like select fare / sbs which you see in eg PDX, NYC (where a transit police officer comes on to the bus randomly to check tickets). So we\'ll have to see what enforcement mechanism they come up with\n\n* On branch lines \nI was under the impression that the branch lines were dead. According to PRT one of the branches (can\'t remember which) is funded as part of another project. The other is planned to roll into a future project. I believe what was meant here is that they will roll into the ""priority corridors"" like the kind you\'re seeing now in McKeesport which was planned under NEXT', 'date': '2024-09-27 15:03:14'}","A PRT update on U-Line project status, including priority signals, project delays, off-board fare, and branch lines."

S. Steel and the USW applicable to USW-represented employees,"" U.S. Steel said. \n\n\n\nThe board cited Nippon\'s written commitments, including a promise not to conduct layoffs during the term of the contract and to invest $1.4 billion in union-represented facilities.  \n\n\n\n""With the arbitration process now behind us, we look forward to moving ahead with our pending transaction with Nippon Steel,"" U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said in a news release.

But the White House has downplayed those reports, saying CIFUS is reviewing the deal for potential national security concerns and could advise against the merger.\n\n\n\nBoth former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have campaigned against the deal. \n\n\n\nBut U.S. Steel has warned that without the deal, thousands of jobs are at risk.

I think I've just come to the acceptance that my dad will never see this team make a world series again and I'll never even see them win one (even if I live to be at least 90).\n\nIt just hurts a lot bc baseball is my favorite sport and my team has always been bad. No Steelers or Penguins championship can take away how great it would feel to finally see the buccos win it all. \n\nI know I'm not the only one who feels this way. Just felt like I needed to type it out and voice my frustration to other people who feel the same way.

"{'title': 'Paul Skenes Might Be In Pittsburgh For Longer Than Yinz Think He Will', 'content': ""Considering how hard he throws, it is more likely than not that he will have a significant arm injury at some point. I know, he has strong mechanics and he and the team will take every precaution and so on.  But the odds are not in his favor.  Therefore he might be receptive to a first, big but not ridiculously big contract as a means of establishing financial security for him and his great grandchildren before moving on to his second and last contract so can afford to buy teams in every major professional sport (and also Formula One auto racing) after he retires.\n\nIn other words, I could absolutely see him signing an extension next year or after the season that would take him through his arbitration years and two or even three of his free agent years. So, let's say a 6 year deal for $150 million plus incentives at the end of the 2025 season---when he will be all of 23 years old. This would enable him to hit the free agent market for his Yankee or Dodger contract at age 29 while still having gazillions in the bank for the rest of his life.\n\nHe might consider something like that. **No, seriously, he might.** As far as I can see, this is a win-win. The Pirates get him for three years past the point at which he would otherwise skip town. Skenes gets a big payout as insurance against career altering (or career ending) injury. And if he stays in one piece, he still gets to cash in on a REALLY big contract at the back end.\n\nWhat's not to like?\n\nPS There is also the fact that Skenes is not wired like a lot of other guys.  He went to the Air Force Academy with every intention of serving in the United States military, like his uncles did in the Air Force and Coast Guard. It would not shock me if he signed this hypothetical Pirates extension and at the end of it said see ya, I'm off to fly B-52s.  Pro athletes have quit to serve in the military in the past.  Just sayin'."", 'date': '2024-09-29 15:35:33'}",Paul Skenes might sign a long-term contract with the Pirates to secure financial stability and potentially enter the NFL and Formula One after retirement.

I have scoured the internet and I have never seen any article pinpointing how much of the team he actually owns or who else has a stake in the team.  In fact, there hasn't been any news at all on the Pirates management group since he bought the team from McClatchy.  \n\nWe always hold Nutting accountable for this teams failings, but he's not the only owner.  There are others out there who are profiting off of his greed.  IMO, they just as guilty for profiting off Nutting greed and should be held accountable.  If billionaire Bob can't be shamed into fielding a competitive team, maybe the silent ownership group can be easier gotten to.\n\nMy point is, Nutting is extremely insulated from any degree of shame but maybe the co-owners aren't.  It's been a generation and nothing is changing at the top.  It's time for different tactics. Maybe we can get through to other owners complicitly taking Pirate money and they can put pressure on Nutting."", 'date': '2024-09-24 12:56:56'}",The document discusses the lack of transparency regarding ownership stakes in the Pirates baseball team and calls for accountability among co-owners.

"{'title': 'Nutting Hate is Lazy, Tired, and Annoyingly Repetitive. Low-Hanging Fruit. ', 'content': 'Bob Nutting has not been a good baseball owner. he has been cheap, frugal, conservative and tone-deaf for the majority of his tenure. \n\nI am not here to defend Nutting and his partners. the Pittsburgh Pirates are my favorite team in any sport, and it’s been that way my whole life. \n\nthe amount of disappointment and heartbreak they’ve provided are a stark and visceral reminder of reality. it depresses me watching another calendar turn to October, and us, once again, not being invited to the dance. \n\nhowever, the Pirates are family. I see PNC Park way more than I see my actually family. this includes the ushers, the vendors and the fellow season-ticket holding fans in our section. we’ve won together, and on more nights that not, we’ve lost together. \n\nI’ve sat through some truly awful baseball in my lifetime. 100+ loss seasons and sparse, lifeless crowds in the latter months of the season(s). we didn’t have that this year. \n\nwith all that said, constantly ripping on Nutting is just tiresome and pointless. it’s a waste of time. \n\nthere’s been a bevy of posts about Nutting on here lately, with the top one today asking if 2024 was his worst job. \n\nare you f*cking kidding me??? are you blind?\n\n2024 was not the result we wanted, but it was in no way an inconsequential failure. it’s actually going to be one of the most significant seasons we’ve had in our lifetime. \n\nnot only are the Pirates going to win more than the Vegas season total for the second straight season, they became nationally significant for the first time in a decade. \n\nthe Pirates handled Paul Skenes as well as anyone could hope. the brought him up a month into the season and despite losing a year of control, did not shut him down or limit his innings. \n\nthey let the Big Dog eat, and there’s a good chance it will lead to only our second ROTY in franchise history (s/o Jason Bay).\n\nSkenes gives the franchise an anchor, a building block, and is must-watch TV. \n\nhis running mate, Jared Jones, absolutely looks like a future cog in the rotation to join Mitch Keller and the studs coming up through the pipeline. \n\nJoey Bart is having a borderline all-star season behind the dish, and we got him off waivers from the Giants. they don’t grow many productive starting catchers on trees, and we have one. \n\nwas it Nutting’s fault that David Bednar inexplicably had his worst season as a professional by a mile and cost us a couple handful of games?\n\nwas it Nutting’s fault that Rowdy Tellez performed as a below-replacement level player? and because he consistently didn’t produce, we saved more money than most Americans make in a year? I would’ve done the same f*cking thing. \n\nwas it Nutting’s fault that umpires blew calls or that it rained that one day in April or that inflation and unemployment are out of control? because the way most of you whine about him on here, I just assume everything is his fault. \n\nyou have to know where to draw the line. blindly shitting on Nutting has reached the point of being a lazy, ignorant, and uneducated form of mob mentality. \n\nlast I checked, the Pirates aren’t for sale. we can either continue to whine incessantly about the owner, or we can choose to be better. (already looking for top comment to be Hi, Bob!”)\n\nas always, Let’s Go Bucs.', 'date': '2024-09-25 18:57:37'}","Bob Nutting's tenure as the owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates is criticized for being disappointing and repetitive, with the team's success in 2024 overshadowing past failures."

"{'title': ""One Fan's Take on Cherington's Tenure as the Pirates GM"", 'content': 'Let me say up front that this post is not meant as rage bait or as a cheap pile on, but rather an attempt to assess the performance of our current General Manager in a more objective sense than our typical frustrated fan\'s perspective. \n\n**My two cents is that Cherington just isn\'t very good at his job.**\n\nIf you look at his career, while he did have the one World Series champion in Boston, this was with a team that was built largely by his predecessor, Theo Epstein. During the time that Cherington was there, he had trainloads of cash behind him and mostly wasted it on terrible free agent signings such as Pablo Sandoval.\n\nWhen he came to Pittsburgh, he was tasked with operating an organization that was on the polar opposite end of the spectrum from the situation he had just left. His margins were much thinner and his resources (in terms of raw amounts of cash) much smaller though not nonexistent. I could be wrong, but I suspect it is much easier for a small market GM to ""graduate"" (so to speak) to a big market team than for anyone but the very best executives to go from big to small and still succeed. The mindset needed to succeed in Boston versus what is needed to field a winning team in Pittsburgh is very different. Worlds apart.\n\nBut alright, he got his chance. Most of his trades---in fact, nearly all of them until very recently---have been awful. Although Neal Huntington richly deserved his firing, he didn\'t exactly leave the cupboard bare when he walked out the door. Cherington mostly squandered those assets for very little in return. In fairness, his deadline deals in 2024 were better (if not exactly scintillating) but don\'t forget who he dealt away in order to acquire Beeks, de la Cruz, IKF, Yorke, and Cook. That\'s not a complaint per se because obviously something needed to be done. I\'m just saying that the final returns are not yet in and those deals may look quite different, for better or for worse, a couple of years from now.\n\n**The strangest thing to my mind is the farm system.** Yes, there are some electric arms and we\'re already seeing some of them and there\'s nothing wrong with any of that. But I can honestly say that in all my years of following major league baseball, I have never--repeat, never--seen an entire organization tipped over so far on its side as the Pirates. Meaning that I\'ve never seen another minor league system that was so badly distorted on one side of the player development ledger (pitching) at the expense of the other (hitting). Nor have I ever seen any other franchise that was as awful at hitting throughout the entire organization as the 2024 Pirates. This obviously calls Cherington\'s hiring and management decisions into question, the more so because it looks to my mind like he is now throwing some of his lieutenants under the bus to try and save his own skin.\n\nI expected more from him. He obviously hasn\'t delivered.

"{'title': 'Do we have any relief pitchers in the minors who could reach the majors next year?', 'content': 'I’m bored at work right now and thinking about how our major league roster could look next year. The call up of Isaac Matson also has me curious, since I had no clue who this dude was before yesterday. I used to love following the pirates minor leagues through pirates prospects, but the owner is kinda psychotic and lost my support last year. Now I’ve been struggling to keep up with our farm system.\n\nI’m also not including current starters who could be moved to the pen in the majors (Burrows or Ashcraft are likely possibilities imo). I think we’ll all be happier if we don’t have to see anyone like Wentz, Jeffries, or Heller in our pen next year, so I’m hoping we have some guys in the farm who could step up!', 'date': '2024-09-20 15:16:54'}",The document discusses the author's thoughts on the Pittsburgh Pirates' minor league roster and potential relief pitchers who could reach the majors next year.

"{'title': 'Some thoughts on the Brewers winning the division.', 'content': ""Congrats Brewers, I don’t like them but it’s better than seeing the Cardinals or Cubs win another division title.\n\nSecond of all, the Cubs were picked by many to win the division at the start of the season. Changing managers isn’t going to get that done and I said as much to Cubs fans here in Iowa and a lot of them agreed with me. I feel like this Cubs team was one of the most overrated teams in recent MLB history.\n\nSo if the Brewers go 1-10 the rest of the way out, they'll have the same record as the 2014 Pirates, the worst of the 3 good Pirates teams of the 2013-15 era.\n\nIt still pisses me off that the 98 win Pirates team in 2015 has the 6th best record in 30 years of NL Central history and yet, they couldn't win a division title. If I hear another idiot Cubs fan complain about 108 years or a Cardinals fan whine about 2023, I’m gonna punch them.\n\nHas any MLB had it worse than Pirates fans since 1979? Probably not. If the Pirates have a good closer in 1992, they go to the World Series. If the Cardinals don’t win 3 straight division titles by a grand total of 7 games, maybe we don’t have to watch two of our best seasons get thrown in the trash by two starting pitchers pitching out of their minds."", 'date': '2024-09-19 02:23:54'}",The document discusses the Brewers' victory in the division and expresses disappointment with the Cubs' and Cardinals' performances.

"{'title': ""2025 isn't looking half bad..."", 'content': ""The baseball season I mean. \n\nAs disappointing as this year has been, the team actually seems pretty well set up for the future. \n\n\nI think we are in a position to let 20 million dollars walk. Grandal, Taylor, Chapman and Tellez might all be gone. McCutchen too - though I'm not celebrating that if it happens. \n\n\nWe will need to replace Chapman but we have multiple AAA arms who will deserve a roster spot and it seems reasonable to me to consider allowing young starting pitchers like Burrows Chandler, Ashcraft, Harrington or even Jones to take those bullpen innings. Call this one a maybe. Maybe it's best to try to retain Chapman, but maybe we already have enough arms ready for their shot.\n\nWe will not need to replace Grandal - we've got 3 young catchers once Endy comes back. \n\nWe will not need to replace Taylor. \n\nIf McCutchen wants to keep doing what he does then he can keep at it again.\n\n\nWe have an opportunity to pursue just one single position player or DH to add to the roster and we only need to check one box with that signing. Can we find one guy who can hit?\n\n\nEvery other position that you may want strengthened has obvious candidates in AAA. Nick Yorke is a 1st round draft pick who seems ready to contribute and he splits his time at OF and 2B. We've got FOUR strong-looking pitchers in AAA who appear to have earned looks, plus Oviedo eventually coming back.\n\n\nI'm not even expecting Nutting to increase the payroll. Just let BC take the money that was going to those guys and spend it on one guy who can hit. Can we do that?\n\n\nEdit: lots of rage-bait in the comments... lol"", 'date': '2024-09-16 15:24:34'}","The document discusses the team's outlook for the 2025 baseball season, highlighting potential roster changes and opportunities for player signings."

We are trash, managed by a trash coach/GM, owned by a trash person. \n\nBringing Shelton back after years of mediocre coaching, questionable decisions, and total collapses down the stretch. I get it, who would wanna come coach this dumpster fire anyways? But we’re not even gonna try and get someone better? That man will never be the coach of a playoff winning/contending team. Similar to the Kenny Pickett Steelers situation, yea, the pirates gave Shelty nothing to work with and he was put in a very tough position, but that doesn’t excuse his poor decision making and constant moments where it seems like he’s completely lost his teams. \n\nWe have the most talented pitcher my generation might ever see on our roster along with a 6’7” freak athlete who can throw his bat out there and hit a ball 420 dead center. And we can’t even enjoy it because of the incompetence that runs this team. Next year, don’t give them the time of day. \n\nSpend nutting, win nutting.

"{'title': 'MLB Conspiracy Theory', 'content': 'This is half baked and I plan to do more research on it. I could very well be wrong.\n\nOffense prior to the all star break was down league wide. Offense around the league since the all-star break has seemed to pick up.\n\nThe pirates, who struggled to hit prior to the all star break, have suddenly moved up through the team offensive rankings. Improvements in guys like Rowdy Tellez and Yasmani Grandal over the summer have helped increase the team average. \n\nConversely, once the pirates started hitting better, their bullpen completely shit the bed. And not just on or two guys. Every guy. What are the chances that the entire bullpen collectively slumped at the same time? Mitch Keller is suddenly getting hit hard. Paul Skenes is being proven to be mortal. Guys who were outstanding the first half of the season are now struggling.\n\nMy theory is that the MLB is juicing the balls again to generate offense. Home runs sell, and having offense down league wide was bad for the league from a marketing standpoint. \n\nThe pirates have been a team that attacks the zone and pitches to contact. What used to be soft contact ground balls and flares in the first half of the season have turned into screaming ground balls and home runs. The pirates pitching philosophy is a doomed one if the league is utilizing juiced balls again. \n\nBut what other explanation could there be that every single pitcher on their team decided to slump at the same time?\n\nJust a theory.\n\nTL;DR \n\nManfred is a cunt and is juicing the balls again and the pirates are suffering for it', 'date': '2024-09-01 19:59:11'}","MLB conspiracy theory suggests the league is juicing balls to boost offense, leading to inconsistent pitching performance across the team."

"{'title': 'Hot Take: Ortiz has been our best pitcher this season', 'content': 'Skenes is electric, we all know that. But Ortiz deserves a ton of praise for his help this season. From his extra innings win in Miami to his start today. He’s had a bad start or 2, but his ability to become a bonafide starter from a bullpen guy has contributed so much to this team. And even as all of our starters have been roughed around at times, he has avoided a total collapse and injury (I stg if he gets put on the IL) and I feel with him we can be more confident in him than even Keller at times. His stats aren’t the best for pitchers on this team but I believe the effects he’s had this season are immense and combined with some other guys looking good, we are in a position that’s much better now than what we could have been.', 'date': '2024-09-01 02:17:32'}","Ortiz has been a key contributor to the team's success this season, despite having inconsistent starts."

"{'title': ""While the Pirates have been struggling tremendously at the major league level, they've quietly dropped into the bottom-10 farm systems in the league."", 'content': ""In the past few years, the typical way of comforting fans through rough major league stretches has been reminding us that we still have a great deal of talent coming down the line. And it was true for a long time: We had highly anticipated debuts like Henry Davis, Paul Skenes, Endy Rodriguez, and Jared Jones all down the line. \n\nNow, we've seen most of our top prospects debut, and there hasn't been much of a replacement for them. It's starting to reflect in our farm rankings: MLB Pipeline put us at 20th, Fangraphs put us at 21st, Bleacher Report put us at 19th, and Baseball America has us at an absolutely dismal 27th! (To be fair, they have always been incredibly low on the Pirates' system--they don't believe in Termarr whatsoever and think a lot of our pitching prospects like Solometo don't have major league stuff)\n\nIn general, it seems like these evaluations are pretty closely tied to an org's evaluation of Termarr: Orgs like Baseball America that don't think he has a major league hit tool are saying that our farm is basically dead, while orgs that still have some faith in Termarr developing into a solid starter have us closer to the middle of the pack. Still nobody who thinks that we have a stacked farm.\n\nHopefully, we'll see some more guys develop out of this system, but as it stands, Ben Cherington has squeezed the last juice out of the fruits of tanking and there's no obvious path he can take to recover. Disaster of a tenure and it's just a shame he made it this long."", 'date': '2024-08-29 13:44:49'}","The Pirates' farm system has fallen to the bottom-10 in the league, with few prospects having made major league debuts."
"{'title': 'The 2024 Pirates are in a worse spot than the 2019 Pirates because of Cherington', 'content': ""I think the absolute biggest way I can criticize Cherington is look at what he did with what he inherited from the 2019 Pirates. Even though the 2019 Pirates had that awful end of season collapse that cost Hurdle and Huntington their jobs, that team had some decent talent and was only 1 year removed from an 82 win season. That team had legitimate trade chips between Bell, Frazier, Marte, Taillon and Musgrove, plus they had Reynolds and Newman as MLB proven young guys and Keller and Hayes as guys who would be ready soon. They also had Cruz as a top prospect in the system already. Overall, the prospect pool was ranked borderline top-10, with Fangraphs having them at 9th overall. The team Cherington inherited had pieces, he wasn't coming into a graveyard of a team.\n\nWhat did he get for the trade chips on that 2019 team? Marte was traded for Peguero and Malone, today Peguero looks like a bench piece with no standout traits and Malone ended up a bust. Taillon was traded for Yajure, Contreras, CSN and Escotto, where they only got 1 mediocre season out of Contreras (who they then lost for nothing) and everyone else was a bust. Bell was traded for Yean and Crowe, where Yean ended up a bust and Crowe was a horrendous MLB pitcher for the Pirates. Frazier was traded for Suwinski, Marcano and Miliano, where they got 1 good season out of Suwinski (who they likely end up moving on from this off-season) and everyone else was a bust. Marcano even later got banned from the MLB entirely for gambling.\n\nMusgrove is the only guy that the Pirates actually got value for, but that value was 95% Bednar and hopes with Endy as a prospect. What value does a great closer even have to a 100 loss team, anyway? If Cherington was a smart GM, he would have sold high on Bednar, but his other trades make me believe he would have just botched that deal as well.\n\nThe team today does have some clearly great pieces to work around. Reynolds and Cruz are really good hitters and Skenes, Jones and Keller is a championship caliber rotation. But beyond that, the Pirates have literally nothing that is proven and reliable going forward. All of ESPN, Fangraphs and Baseball America have the Pirates as a bottom-10 prospect pool after Skenes and Jones have graduated, and it looks like there is nothing in the system that will fix any of their issues the MLB team has. Without them lucking into the #1 overall pick to get Skenes, I think their situation would look monumentally worse as well.\n\nNo one can deny that this team is absolutely crippled by Nutting, that's a factual statement. But you simply cannot look at Cherington's tenure as the Pirates GM as anything but a major failure with what he inherited versus what they have now. Even though the records won't show this, I think this team is simply in a worse spot now than they were in 2019. If that doesn't paint how major of a failure his tenure has been, I don't know what will."", 'date': '2024-08-29 16:51:49'}","Cherington's 2019 Pirates team had decent talent, but his trades resulted in multiple busts, leading to a worse situation than before."

"{'title': 'As fans, why do we still care?', 'content': ""I'm genuinely curious to hear what everyone has to say about this, but first, let me just speak honestly.\n\nI was born in 1991, and I've literally been a Pirate fan since I was a year old. My parents and I had season tickets from 1993-2015, and probably would have kept them past 2015 if the organization didn't push us out of our seats in favor of new, bandwagon, full season ticket holders. I sat there as a kid in sweltering 99 degree days in the metal seats of section 533 at Three Rivers Stadium, watching my hero Jason Kendall dislocate his ankle trying to break up a no hitter with a bunt.\n\nI've seen so much failure on the part of this organization. I've also seen 3 incredibly magical seasons of playoff baseball, that I never could have imagined. Sitting in 316 for the 2013 NL Wild Card Game, unable to hear myself think due to the deafening noise, I truly believed we were back.\n\nNow, let me flash forward to the final game of 2019, when I was a groundskeeper at PNC Park. I remember the confusion and shock on the entire crew's faces when we found out that Clint Hurdle had been fired minutes before first pitch, and just shortly after we stood around talking to him. It felt wrong, and it felt like the organization was about to take a huge step back. But, again, I could never imagine it would be like this.\n\n32 years, with some of the most horrendous baseball, and today, I can honestly say, I've never been more disgusted to be a Pirate fan. This season has been exhausting, but we've been told that they're going to add, they're going to compete. Their window is opening. But this is the most unenjoyable, unexciting team, that is devoid of any enthusiasm. 41 runs in 3 games. A Pittsburgh Pirate team, who has been around since 1887, has never given up 41 runs in 3 games, until this week. And yet, we're told to keep believing. Keep believing in a team where Derek Shelton took a knee in back to back winnable games, by putting in the most pathetic relievers in crucial situations. Believe in a team that lacks any sort of understanding of fundamentals. Believe in a team, whose bottom of the order features 3 guys, on any given day, with a sub .200 batting average, and sub .700 OPS. My extremely devoted father just told me that, for the first time, he is embarrassed to be a fan.\n\nSo, that brings me back to my initial question, for everyone here. Why do we continue to care? Why do we continue to be sucked into this toxic relationship with this organization? My apologies for the long rant, but after this series, I just had to flip out."", 'date': '2024-08-28 21:24:09'}",Pirates fans' continued passion despite poor performance and controversies.

"{'title': 'Would a league-wide salary cap and floor help the Buccos become more competitive?', 'content': ""I was unfortunately at that sweltering hot shitshow today. My friends said 'watch them lose' and they're not exactly prophets. But, I digress. I am a hockey fan and spoiled by the Penguins. Hockey has a strict salary cap and floor. Yes, teams occasionally make ding dong moves to reach that floor and generally aren't competitive when you compare them to a cap team, but it's not a large range.\n\nIt absolutely brings more parity. Money is a resource that buys players. Logic dictates keeping the playing field more equal leads to more parity. There really isn't a good argument against it if you want competitive baseball or sports in general.\n\n1 goddamn wild card game win since 1992 (2013). This is ridiculous. I know a lot is due to extreme mismanagement, terrible drafting, and an air of 'we're losers' that starts at the stinky ownership, but c'mon.\n\nCasual fans hate this crap and it's why baseball is a dying sport. There needs to be a salary cap. My question to this subreddit is--would it help the Buccos, or would we just see the same old show all over again? Curious what the takes are on this."", 'date': '2024-08-28 22:39:56'}","A hockey fan discussing the benefits of a salary cap and floor in baseball, questioning its impact on the Boston Red Sox."
