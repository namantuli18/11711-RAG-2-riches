Pittsburgh PenguinsPittsburgh Penguins, American professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Penguinshave won the Stanley Cup ﬁve times (1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017).Founded during the 1967 National Hockey League (NHL) expansion, the Penguins took their name from theigloolike appearance of Mellon Arena, where the team played from its inception through the 2009–10 season.After ﬁnding moderate success in the 1970s and then struggling throughout the early 1980s, the Penguins draftedMario Lemieux in 1984, who was an instant offensive force on the ice and would become one of the greatestplayers in the history of the game. As the club drafted and traded for other standout players, the Penguins becamea regular presence in the playoffs in the late 1980s. After the addition of right wing Jaromir Jagr, they won boththe 1991 and 1992 Stanley Cup championships.In 1993 team captain Lemieux was diagnosed with Hodgkin disease; however, he overcame the disease and notonly returned to the team after a year off but also led the league in goals during the 1995–96 season. FollowingLemieux’s initial retirement in 1997, Jagr became team captain and won the league scoring title four years in arow (from 1997–98 to 2000–01).The Penguins franchise struggled ﬁnancially, and the team ﬁled for bankruptcy in 1998. The following yearLemieux converted years of unpaid salary to equity and became a part owner of the team. In 2000 he leftretirement and became the ﬁrst player-owner in the history of the NHL before retiring again midway through the2005–06 season.In 2005 a new Penguins era began with the drafting of Sidney Crosby, who in 2006–07 was the NHL’s leadingscorer and, at age 19, became the youngest team captain in NHL history. In the 2007–08 season Crosby andsecond-year star Evgeni Malkin led the Penguins to the Stanley Cup ﬁnals, which they lost to the Detroit RedWings. The following season Malkin led the NHL in points while Crosby ﬁnished third. That year the Penguinsﬁnished fourth in the Atlantic Division but advanced again to the Stanley Cup ﬁnals, this time defeating the RedWings in seven games.In the six seasons after the 2009 Stanley Cup win, Pittsburgh remained one of the best teams in the NHL, runningoff a franchise record three straight seasons with at least 100 points (a team receives two points for a victory, onefor an overtime loss, and none for a regulation loss) between 2009–10 and 2011–12 and winning three divisiontitles. However, the team failed to advance past the conference ﬁnals over that span, losing to a lower-seeded teamin ﬁve of the six postseasons. The team broke through in 2015–16, ending the regular season on a hot streak thatcarried over into the postseason, during which the Penguins captured another Stanley Cup title (over the San JoseSharks in six games). The Penguins tallied the second most points in the NHL (111) in 2016–17, and in thepostseason the team won seven-game series in both the second round and Eastern Conference ﬁnals to return tothe Stanley Cup ﬁnals, where they faced the Nashville Predators. The Penguins then defeated the Predators in sixgames, becoming the ﬁrst NHL team to win consecutive Stanley Cups since 1998. Pittsburgh returned to the
playoffs in 2018 but lost in the second round, and in 2019 the team was swept in its ﬁrst-round series. The nexttwo NHL seasons were shortened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Penguins failed to advance past thequalifying round of the 2019–20 playoffs, and the following year the team lost in the ﬁrst round of the postseason.Adam Augustyn
